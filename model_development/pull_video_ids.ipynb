We truly couldn't have done this without\", 'Right now 100 million radiation-blasted\\xa0\\n flesh-eating flies are raining down over the jungles of Panama – to commit \\n a genocide that can never end. Their\\xa0tiny bodies are rebuilding a wall of \\n\\xa0flesh that protects an entire continent. This is one of humanity\\'s most\\xa0successful \\n wars, going on for\\xa0over 50 years now. Fought from Central America\\xa0\\n to the deserts of Libya. Ok, so what\\'s going on? The Unbeatable Flesh Eating Fly We need to talk about one of the most \\n terrifying\\xa0parasites on earth for a moment. Don’t worry,\\xa0we won’t make it too gross. If you want to\\xa0skip this part, \\n jump to the next chapter. Cochliomyia hominivorax – which \\n literally means\\xa0\"the man eater.\"  The New World Screwworm fly,\\xa0\\n at home in the Americas.  Each of these\\xa0metallic blue-green flies \\n with bright red\\xa0eyes that exist in nature is here because it\\xa0feasted on the \\n flesh of a warm blooded animal. Cochliomyia can detect wounds and \\n smell blood\\xa0across vast distances. If a human, a deer or a\\xa0squirrel has the tiniest scratch, \\n female screwworm\\xa0flies will try to lay eggs in the wound.  When\\xa0they hatch the worms start eating \\n healthy flesh\\xa0with sharp mandibles. Causing horrible wounds,\\xa0\\n attracting even more flies. In serious cases the\\xa0animal will die, \\n or at least be severely weakened. Cochliomyia doesn’t add anything positive\\xa0\\n to the world and is a natural enemy of ours. For most of history, this parasite was\\xa0\\n simply a horrifying fact of life in the\\xa0Americas. And then we accidently created\\xa0\\n a paradise for them. As farmers introduced\\xa0millions and millions of \\n cows to the vast\\xa0expanses of the southern US, screwworms\\xa0became a catastrophic problem and a \\n source of\\xa0endless suffering for our defenseless cattle. One outbreak might wipe out herds and lead to\\xa0cruel, \\n lingering deaths for countless animals in the wild. Traditional pesticides were\\xa0\\n useless against Cochliomyia because you\\xa0couldn\\'t poison something \\n that lived inside\\xa0a living animal\\'s flesh. You couldn\\'t prevent\\xa0animals from getting \\n injured or flies from\\xa0finding wounds. The situation seemed hopeless\\xa0\\n and Cochliomyia was winning. Ranchers had to\\xa0spend countless hours \\n examining their herds,\\xa0treating wounds, trying to protect newborns,\\xa0watching \\n helplessly as their animals suffered. And then two scientists in the 1950s\\xa0had an idea \\n that was too wild to be\\xa0taken seriously at first: What if\\xa0we kind of \\'nuke\\' the screwworms? Radioactive Parasite Factories Screwworm flies have a major weakness – female\\xa0\\n Cochliomyia can lay up to 400 eggs, multiple\\xa0times. But they only mate a single time before\\xa0\\n they die at the ripe-old age of three weeks. So what if we could somehow \\n disrupt the mating\\xa0process? What if we could flood the \\n environment\\xa0with sterile male flies? The females would waste\\xa0their one and only chance at \\n reproduction on males\\xa0that couldn\\'t produce offspring. An entire species\\xa0could theoretically \\n mate itself out of existence. But how do you sterilize millions of flies\\xa0without killing \\n them or making them too weak\\xa0to compete for mates? Well it turned out\\xa0the timing to \\n do this was kind of perfect. Scientists studying the effects\\xa0of radiation had discovered \\n that\\xa0specific doses could damage reproductive cells while leaving the rest of an organism intact. So all we needed to do was to figure out\\xa0\\n how high this dose was for Cochliomyia, breed millions of flies, irradiate them and\\xa0\\n release them over thousands of square kilometers. Imagine explaining this idea to someone\\xa0in 1950. Imagine the scale of the damage\\xa0and the suffering \\n that Cochliomyia caused for\\xa0people to say: Ok sure, let’s try this, why not? To prove this could work, scientists \\n built\\xa0a screwworm paradise in Florida and shipped\\xa0millions of flies to \\n the remote island\\xa0of Curacao. Long trays were filled with\\xa0ground beef and \\n horse meat, animal blood, milk\\xa0and eggs. Thousands were bred, irradiated and\\xa0released \\n into the wild in regular intervals. As the weeks and months passed more and \\n more of the Cochliomyia on the island were infertile and mated with regular ones. First slowly and\\xa0then suddenly they were no more. Completely\\xa0eradicated. It was time to think much bigger. Over the next few decades a war was declared and professional worm factories \\n established to\\xa0breed them by the billions. A single plant\\xa0in Texas alone needed 70 tons \\n of meat and\\xa012,000 gallons of blood  to breed 150 million\\xa0flies per week. The disgusting mix had to be\\xa0kept warm because \\n they had to believe\\xa0they were inside a living animal. This lovely process made the insects smell so bad\\xa0\\n that airlines initially refused to transport them. Their transport boxes had to be sprayed \\n with\\xa0cologne just to get them on planes. Bit by bit,\\xa0in a slow-moving wave of biological \\n warfare,\\xa0the program eradicated screwworms. First from\\xa0Florida, then across Texas, \\n through\\xa0Mexico, and into Central America. Every step required billions of sterile flies,\\xa0\\n massive coordination, and unwavering dedication\\xa0\\n from thousands of workers. It was an incredible\\xa0victory of \\n humanity over the horrors of nature. In 1988, the war suddenly became global and\\xa0for \\n the first time ever, screwworms escaped to\\xa0Africa. The stakes were astronomical –  \\n if not\\xa0stopped immediately, flesh-eating Cochliomyia\\xa0could move down the \\n Nile Valley, around the\\xa0North African coast and conquer regions where\\xa0medical care \\n was scarce or non-existent.\\xa0 The potential suffering was incalculable. To stop this invasion a herculean \\n operation was\\xa0triggered immediately. Hundreds of Millions of\\xa0\\n sterile flies were flown in. Ground teams\\xa0inspected millions \\n of animals for wounds. Communication campaigns explained to \\n locals\\xa0why planes were dropping boxes full of millions\\xa0of flesh \\n eating American flies. But it worked. In just four months, the invasion was stopped. But Cochliomyia still held a firm grip over\\xa0the \\n Amazon rainforest and much of\\xa0South America. An area too large,\\xa0politically complicated \\n and expensive to expand\\xa0the war further. So a deal was made with Panama,\\xa0the \\n narrowest part of the continent –  the US\\xa0and Mexico would pay for \\n a wall of flesh in the\\xa0small country.  It would prevent any screwworms \\n from reaching the north ever again. Today, deep in Panama, a nuclear worm\\xa0\\nfactory runs 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, producing an endless stream of sterile flies. The technology has come a long way from \\n the\\xa0early days – instead of ground meat  a brown\\xa0protein sludge made from \\n powdered blood, milk\\xa0and eggs is piped into trays stacked in rooms\\xa0kept at \\n exactly the same temperature as living\\xa0tissue. Thousands of flies are then carefully\\xa0\\n irradiated with precise doses of radiation, creating Cochliomyia that act\\xa0\\n normal but are dead inside. Each week 100 million flies are loaded\\xa0\\n into rotating dispersal machines to be released mid-flight in a finely tuned\\xa0\\n balance of drop rate, speed and altitude. The flight paths are separated by precisely 1.6\\xa0\\n kilometers in an choreographed aerial ballet, creating an invisible wall of sterile flies. Surveillance teams cover some of the \\n most remote and challenging terrain to check\\xa0animals for injuries and monitor \\n for any\\xa0sign of screwworm activity. Unfortunately\\xa0right now the wall is failing and \\n the\\xa0war against Cochliomyia is far from over. Cochliomyia strikes back In 2016 Cochliomyia somehow made \\n their way back\\xa0to the Florida Keys turning the paradise islands\\xa0into a nightmare. Key deer were suddenly walking\\xa0\\n around with gaping wounds. Millions of sterile\\xa0flies were \\n rushed in from Panama, creating a\\xa0front around the outbreak \\n and beginning the\\xa0eradication again. Within months,\\xa0the invasion \\n was at least contained. And in late 2023 the wall in Panama failed\\xa0\\n and Cochliomyia struck back immediately. Like\\xa0a parasitic firestorm on speed it spread \\n again\\xa0all over Panama and Costa Rica. Burning through\\xa0Central America \\n and even reaching Mexiko. The\\xa0worm factory now produces \\n sterile worms at maximum\\xa0capacity, it is a real biological emergency\\xa0\\n and it\\'s not clear when it will be over. One day we might be able to win the war against\\xa0\\n this horrible monster, we did so before, and other\\xa0parasites have been eradicated \\n from much of the\\xa0world or even entirely. So if you find yourself\\xa0in Central America \\n and see a low flying plane\\xa0overhead, maybe you are witnessing another day\\xa0in \\n one of humanity\\'s most unusual wars – a war we\\xa0can never stop fighting \\n and can\\'t afford to lose.

Their loved ones, any other possessions\\xa0or \\n pursuits, homes, their dignity and even their lives. But actually Fentanyl is garbage Heroin, \\n inferior\\xa0in every single way but one. It's the perfect drug for dealers.  And while we hear a lot about\\xa0how deadly Fentanyl is, \\n many people it kills are\\xa0not even Fentanyl addicts. It is truly the\\xa0dumbest drug to ruin your life for. Let’s\\xa0learn what Fentanyl does to you, what it \\n feels\\xa0like and why it’s so much lamer than heroin. Pain and Pleasure Maybe the two most important forces that\\xa0\\n guide our survival are pain and pleasure. Pain may be the most visceral physical\\xa0experience. A claw ripping your flesh. A bone cracking. Rejection eating\\xa0your soul. Pain can be scary and\\xa0unbearable – it’s the strongest signal\\xa0our \\n bodies have to make us avoid harm. Pleasure is what makes life good \\n because\\xa0it feels...well, amazing! Eating things\\xa0that are sweet or high-fat, having sex,\\xa0\\n or opening another booster pack with your\\xa0friends. Anything that makes you feel\\xa0\\n pleasure makes you want to do it again. These two opposing forces guide you through\\xa0life. Pain shouts “Stop! This is bad!”. Pleasure cheers “More! Do that again!”. But while they are opposites, they are\\xa0also linked – sometimes our body needs to end\\xa0\\n pain and create pleasure at the same time. After giving birth, pain gets toned\\xa0down \\n and the mother is showered in\\xa0happy hormones  so she can bond with the\\xa0newborn child. During an intense hunt,\\xa0the hunter forgets \\n the physical exhaustion and minor injuries. Both are technically not great experiences\\xa0\\n but need to be repeated for our survival. And nature invented a powerful \\n mechanism to\\xa0achieve this: The mighty opioid receptor.\\xa0\\xa0 It's like a keyhole on the neurons \\n that control pain and pleasure. If activated it\\xa0reduces pain and \\n how much you care about pain\\xa0– and it creates pleasure and good feelings. The details are complex and \\n not relevant for\\xa0this story. What you need to know is that\\xa0any molecule that can \\n fit into an opioid\\xa0receptor like a key, is called an opioid. Opioids are extremely powerful, so when your body uses natural\\xa0opioids \\n like endorphins when you laugh, it\\xa0releases only a tiny amount, \\n exactly where\\xa0they're needed. So the effects are mild and\\xa0localized. Your sprained ankle feels better, a painful memory subsides, you get a\\xa0boost of happiness meeting an old friend. And now we are getting to drugs. Humans\\xa0found opioids in nature, like \\n Morphine,\\xa0and were quite taken by them. They got\\xa0refined into a whole family of drugs used\\xa0in \\n hospitals and to relieve patients that\\xa0are in immense pain. Codeine, Oxycontin, Vicodin. And of course Heroin and the worst of all: Fentanyl. Before we can explain why Fentanyl is\\xa0the \\n most garbage drug, we need to do\\xa0something fun. Let’s inject some heroin together! Ready? The Supernova of Pleasure Heroin rushes through your entire body \\n and\\xa0flips every opioid receptor it finds. A rapid\\xa0cascade of things happens everywhere, all\\xa0at once. A symphony of intense sensations. Every cell regulating pleasure is now high. Without their control floodgates of happy\\xa0hormones \\n open and fill you up top to bottom with\\xa0pure bliss. A cup of coffee? A nectar of joy. This song you like? A celestial symphony. A\\xa0cuddle? Pure love from the center of the universe… Wherever you felt pain before, from wounds or\\xa0\\n aching joints or menstrual cramps, or loneliness or self loathing – it's gone now. You are simply\\xa0\\nunable to feel pain or care about it anymore. Like dimming the lights in a cozy\\xa0room your brain’s alert system is\\xa0put to sleep \\n and you feel at ease, warm\\xa0and serene. Any stress melts away and\\xa0\\n dissolves into a dreamlike haze. You're no longer worried or tense about anything. This peace even spreads to your \\n essential\\xa0organs, slowing your breath, soothing and\\xa0slowing your intestines. Your chest rises\\xa0and falls like \\n the gentle waves of a quiet\\xa0shore. You are sailing a sea of calm and\\xa0\\n happiness that feels perfect and eternal. The full load of a strong opioid\\xa0\\n like heroin, for the very first time, is one of the most amazing \\n feelings humans can\\xa0experience. For a few hours you are in heaven. And this is exactly the problem. Your brain\\xa0is not equipped \\n to handle anything like it. You feel too good. But nothing lasts\\xa0forever \\n and now you are in trouble. You just experienced the \\n best feeling you ever\\xa0felt. Your brain's reward center is completely\\xa0\\n fried and can’t comprehend what happened. If what\\xa0you did felt this good, it has to be amazing \\n for\\xa0your survival and you should do it again. Except\\xa0you can never ever feel this good again. This will\\xa0be your peak life moment forever. You may forever\\xa0chase this feeling \\n you had this very first time. And now you are back in the regular world.\\xa0\\n With your insecurities, where your knee hurts, regular tasting coffee and having\\xa0\\n to work hard for happy hormones. Comparison is the thief of joy, and now you have\\xa0\\n your life to compare to a supernova of bliss. The indescribable feeling comes with\\xa0a damage to \\n your sense of life and\\xa0self that may be irreparable. And this is not even the worst: opioids are incredibly addictive – and the\\xa0\\n addiction among the worst you can have. The Supernova of Pain Once you’ve taken opioids a few \\n times, your\\xa0brain has had enough. The cells controlling\\xa0pain and pleasure \\n are constantly high and\\xa0drowsy. So it boosts them and makes them\\xa0hyperactive. This happens very fast, sometimes\\xa0\\n after a few days of use. You've developed an\\xa0opioid tolerance, toning down \\n all the nice\\xa0effects you are doing the drugs to achieve. To feel like before, you’ll need way higher\\xa0doses. Now you are at a crossroads. Quit and\\xa0have your system go \\n back to normal fairly\\xa0quickly.  Or keep going and take more. You take the wrong turn. Over the next\\xa0few weeks your brain keeps \\n pushing back\\xa0and you keep taking more. The effects are not\\xa0quite what \\n they were, but still mildly nice. Until one day you can’t get opioids and \\n realize\\xa0your body is now your enemy. Your systems are so\\xa0hyperactive that they make \\n you feel the opposite\\xa0of what the drug was doing. Welcome to withdrawal. It all starts with a creeping unease. Instead\\xa0of being euphoric and happy, \\n nothing feels\\xa0good anymore. Your coffee is tasteless. Your\\xa0favorite song lame. Your loved ones distant. A storm of negative emotions \\n shatters your sea of\\xa0calm. Serenity is replaced by anxiety and angst, \\n\\xa0like something terrible is imminent. Your\\xa0worries, insecurities and \\n all the fears\\xa0you suppressed  aren’t just back, but amplified\\xa0\\n into an existential crisis. You’re so restless\\xa0you can’t sit still. Your heart is beating\\xa0too fast. You shiver. Sweat. Hyperventilate. Your pain circuits are now oversensitive, so your \\n bones and muscles ache and hurt\\xa0for no reason.  Old wounds, physical and mental\\xa0torture you. You have belly cramps and \\n diarrhea\\xa0and have to vomit. You’re too agitated to rest. A war inside your body that you can’t escape. And of course there is the craving \\n screaming\\xa0for you to make it stop. Your mind and body\\xa0beg for a hit. You can be in this state for\\xa0up to two weeks. Or make it stop right away. Ok so why not just take heroin \\n forever\\xa0and feel amazing always? The fun thing\\xa0is that it doesn’t work this way – you get\\xa0tolerant to the nice effects, like euphoria,\\xa0faster \\n than the bad ones, like dangerously\\xa0slow breathing. So it turns from touching\\xa0\\xa0the love center of the universe \\n to mostly\\xa0drowsy numbness and relief from withdrawal. Now you don’t take opiates to\\xa0\\n get to heaven but to avoid hell. You're in a prison of your mind and body, unable to connect with all the things \\n\\xa0that could actually make you feel good. Opioid\\xa0addiction is brutal and \\n extremely hard to escape. It should be pretty clear that you need to\\xa0\\n be extremely careful with any opioids – and\\xa0if you have the chance \\n to do it for fun\\xa0– just don’t. There is a very real risk\\xa0that \\n your life might just be over. And that you'll go through hell. Now that we have seen the heaven and hell of\\xa0\\n Heroin, we can get to Fentanyl. The garbage drug. Fentanyl is Really Garbage Heroin Everything we just described is true in \\n different\\xa0intensities for most opioids. They can be great,\\xa0all of them can be hell.  Heroin is\\xa0just sort of the strongest. Except\\xa0it isn’t.  Fentanyl is around 50 times \\n more potent\\xa0than heroin – but this doesn’t mean 50\\xa0times \\n more amazing, quite the opposite. Fentanyl is extremely good at\\xa0\\n crossing the blood-brain barrier, the firewall that protects your \\n brain from\\xa0harmful substances.  It enters your brain\\xa0so easily that you get \\n from 0 to extremely high\\xa0almost instantly. But just as fast as it enters,\\xa0it leaves again. A Heroin high can last six\\xa0hours, \\n one from Fentanyl can fade in minutes. Fentanyl doesn't feel as good as Heroin. Instead\\xa0of a supernova of bliss you \\n mostly get the black\\xa0hole of nodding away. But it comes\\xa0with all the withdrawal symptoms. As a bonus, because Fentanyl acts so quickly on\\xa0\\n your brain, it fries your reward center even more, making it even more addictive than Heroin. And since you only need so little of it,\\xa0it's \\n super easy to overdose and die by\\xa0accident. It is the deadliest illegal\\xa0drug in US history by far. Between 2013 and\\xa02023, \\n it killed about 400,000 Americans. Fentanyl really is garbage Heroin. Too\\xa0dangerous, too intense, \\n too addictive,\\xa0too little fun. But then why\\xa0are so many people taking it? Well. Actually, nobody wants to. Fentanyl\\xa0is not for users. It’s for dealers. The House Always Wins Fentanyl is a drug dealer’s dream. One truck\\xa0load could supply \\n the entire US for one year. It's cheap to make and easy to smuggle. Heroin\\xa0needs plants and \\n fields and way more space. So garbage Fentanyl just \\n took over the Heroin\\xa0supply. It might have seemed great \\n for Heroin\\xa0addicts at first. And then its trap snapped\\xa0close. While some people may \\n seek out Fentanyl\\xa0specifically, several studies have found\\xa0\\n that most opioid users try to avoid it. Even worse, a lot of people who die\\xa0\\n from Fentanyl, don’t take it willingly. Dealers want people to \\n come back for\\xa0their product. And by adding a tiny\\xa0trace of Fentanyl to \\n any drug,\\xa0they can make it more addictive. Even if people don’t realize they took\\xa0\\n an opioid, they'll feel its effects. So dealers started to mix all\\xa0\\n kinds of drugs with Fentanyl, turning the entire US drug market into\\xa0a \\n minefield, where any trip can be your\\xa0last. Because way too often, they\\xa0\\n put a bit too much in their mixes. In 2022 the combination with pills\\xa0\\n – often counterfeit oxycodone and benzodiazepines – accounted for\\xa0\\n about 20% of all Fentanyl deaths. In 2023 the US authorities seized \\n 115 million\\xa0pills with Fentanyl. 70% contained a lethal dose. About half of Fentanyl overdoses\\xa0\\n came where you expect it the least, from stimulants like cocaine and meth. A lot of\\xa0people may have taken \\n these mixes on purpose, but many others just wanted to party \\n and weren't ready for an opioid surprise. This is\\xa0especially dangerous because, if you’ve \\n never\\xa0tried opioids, you can overdose very easily. Fentanyl really has no \\n upsides outside\\xa0medical use. For dealers and cartells\\xa0it means easy profit. For users it means a\\xa0worse \\n opioid addiction and a worse life. For people who would never ever try it, it can\\xa0\\n be a death sentence they didn’t see coming. No matter how alluring they are using opioids,\\xa0even \\n in safe settings, is playing with fire on\\xa0the best of days. Fentanyl is a garbage drug\\xa0that \\n turns this fire into a raging furnace, increasing the risk of death massively. There\\xa0really is only one conclusion to draw here: if you have the choice, don’t step \\n into the supernova of pleasure – because\\xa0the danger of it turning into \\n a\\xa0supernova of pain is just too high. Getting to the root of an issue \\n requires looking\\xa0at all sides and thinking critically about \\n the\\xa0information we consume. In today’s world, this can\\xa0be difficult. This is why Ground News is \\n such an\\xa0important tool today. We believe in their mission\\xa0and are \\n proud to have them sponsor this video. In a nutshell, the app and website combine the\\xa0\\n world’s news in one place so we can do just that. Take a reporting on a US bill about\\xa0\\n harder punishments for Fentanyl smugglers. Fewer than 75 sources worldwide reported\\xa0on \\n the story – but the headlines were\\xa0quite different. You can follow along\\xa0by \\n scanning the QR code on screen. Some of them were critical and compared the\\xa0\\n policy to the war on drugs in the 1970ies. Other sources praised the step \\n and said it could\\xa0end the crisis. And some media outlets asked if\\xa0the \\n smugglers are really the problem  and if policy\\xa0makers shouldn’t focus on \\n the problem of demand in\\xa0the US itself. The interesting thing is that no\\xa0\\n government-funded sources are covering the topic. Reading the news this way lets you compare different \\n sides and the context of a story in one place so you can analyze  the information\\xa0for yourself. You get a sense of different\\xa0perspectives  and can hold yourself accountable to\\xa0\\n avoid information bubbles and confirmation bias.

So let’s very seriously and\\xa0\\nscientifically answer some of them! Question 1:\\nHow many Jellyfish do\\xa0you need to power Tokyo? Tokyo is a hungry beast, gobbling up around\\xa0\\n280 terawatt hours of electricity every year. That’s more energy than these twenty countries\\xa0\\ncombined, and more than all\\xa0of Australia. Can we power Tokyo with our\\xa0\\ninnovative renewable energy source? Some jelly species like Aequorea victoria or\\xa0\\nCrystal Jelly contain fluorescent proteins\\xa0\\xa0 and glow in the dark. If you put one\\xa0\\nof them in front of a tiny solar panel,\\xa0\\xa0 you’d end up with something like a microwatt\\xa0\\nhour of energy. To meet Tokyo’s outrageous energy demands, you’d need: a quintillion\\xa0\\nthree hundred quadrillion glowing jellies. Hmmm...That’s too many. Can we use bigger ones? How about Nemopilema nomurai, the\\xa0\\nNomura jellyfish! Really chunky boys, weighing about as much as a piano and growing up\\xa0\\nto 2m wide, they’re armed with around a thousand spindly tentacles that grow up to four meters long\\xa0\\nand help them suck up plankton from the water. In recent years, their numbers have been\\nexploding, wreaking havoc on local ecosystems. Using these fridge-sized jellies to power\\xa0\\nTokyo will finally give them something\\xa0\\xa0 more useful to do. They don’t glow in the dark\\nbut\\xa0jellyfish are kind of electric, aren’t they? Unfortunately: no. If you’ve ever been stung by a\\xa0jellyfish\\nyou know it feels like\\xa0a painful electric jolt – but the\\xa0pain actually comes from hundreds\\nof\\xa0nematocysts inside their tentacles, tiny dart guns filled with venom. So how do we get energy from\\xa0jellyfish? We’ll squeeze it\\xa0out of them\\nwith the power of piezoelectricity! Piezoelectricity is an electric\\xa0\\ncharge that builds up in certain solid materials like crystals or bone\\nwhen\\xa0you stress and squeeze them. For example,\\xa0a quartz crystal is made up\\nof positive and\\xa0negatively charged atoms arranged in repeating\\xa0pyramid shapes. Their charges usually cancel\\xa0each\\nother out. But if you apply enough pressure, atoms shift out of place and the pyramids become\\xa0\\nkind of wonky. Positively charged on one side\\xa0\\xa0 and negatively charged on the other – like a\\xa0\\nbattery. Together they add up to a charge across the whole crystal. Piezoelectricity\\xa0\\npowers sonar, times quartz watches,\\xa0\\xa0 and some nightclubs use it to keep the lights\\xa0\\non just from the stamping of dancers’ feet. So, here’s the plan: we will create a\\xa0\\nginormous battery from jellyfish by harnessing\\xa0\\xa0 the hypnotic movements of Nomura’s\\nhundreds of long, thin\\xa0tentacles. First, we squeeze our jellyfish, one tentacle at a time, into a kind of wetsuit\\xa0\\nmade from nylon-11,11: a cutting edge material\\xa0\\xa0 that has been optimized for power production and\\xa0\\nhas the same piezoelectric properties as quartz. Next, we watch as each twitch of a tentacle bends\\xa0\\nthe tiny nylon nanofibers of the jelly suit,\\xa0\\xa0 converting its movements into electricity.\\xa0\\nAll we need to do now is to plug our jelly into a current collector with a copper\\xa0\\ncable to be utterly disappointed. Even with around 1000 tentacles\\xa0\\nwrapped in energy-generating nylon, the electricity generated only adds up\\nto around 1 Watt, or 10 kWh per year. Enough\\xa0energy to run your laptop for twenty days.\\nNot bad, but we want to power Tokyo here! We need more jellies! WAY MORE!\\xa0\\nAbout 29 billion! Sounds like a lot,\\xa0\\xa0 and it is, but right now there\\xa0are 27 billion chickens alive on Earth.\\nSo it's mostly a matter of motivation on our part. A single Nomura can produce millions of jelly\\xa0\\nbabies a month, and with enough plankton to eat,\\xa0\\xa0 they can grow from the size of a grain of rice\\xa0\\nto the size of a person in less than a year.\\xa0\\xa0 If we want to breed a lot of them and fast, all we need to do is to basically\\xa0\\nempty the Pacific of plankton. And of course we’ll need space to store\\xa0\\nthem all. Giving each Nomura a cube of\\xa0\\xa0 space measuring 5 meters on each side sounds\\xa0\\ngenerous, but it barely contains the tentacles.\\xa0\\xa0 All those jelly-cubes add up to a tank that’s\\xa0\\nabout seven times the total volume of Mt. Fuji. With all those tentacles and cables, our\\xa0\\nbiggest issue will be short circuits.\\xa0\\xa0 We need to insulate all 29 billion cables. And\\xa0\\ndon’t forget the tentacles themselves. Now, even\\xa0\\xa0 if the jellies get tangled up, we can maintain a\\xa0\\nsteady power supply for the good people of Tokyo. In reality of course, our jellyfish powerstation\\xa0\\nwould be pretty difficult to maintain. Nomura\\xa0would probably die constantly and\\nneed\\xa0to be replaced. And the cost of building this whole mess and killing the ocean\\xa0\\nto feed them would be like spending\\xa0\\xa0 $1 million dollars to buy a single dollar bill. We’re not saying any of this is a good\\xa0\\nidea. But now we've done the math, there's nothing to stop you from giving it a try. Okay, bring on the next totally dumb,\\xa0\\n– uhm, completely reasonable question! Question 2:\\xa0 What if it rained bananas\\xa0instead\\xa0\\nof water for a whole day? Ok, so first, we tried to calculate what\\xa0\\nwould happen if for one day every single\\xa0\\xa0 rain droplet was now a banana. Turns out in\\xa0\\na storm, several million raindrops can fall\\xa0\\xa0 on a single square meter. Which stacks\\xa0\\nquickly to the equivalent of a banana\\xa0\\xa0 asteroid smashing into the planet and killing\\xa0\\nall life. While fun, this is a bit too much. Instead let’s take the average volume of rain\\xa0\\nthat falls on our planet in a single day,\\xa0\\xa0 about 1.33 trillion tons of water – a massive,\\xa0\\nwobbly orb of water 14 kilometers across. Now let’s swap this water for bananas. Each fruit weighs about 120 g, which will give us\\xa0\\na daily banana-fall of 11.1 quadrillion bananas, weighing 1.33 trillion tons in total. If\\xa0\\nwe match average global rainfall patterns,\\xa0\\xa0 even the Sahara Desert would\\xa0\\nreceive around 15 trillion bananas. If a medium sized banana has about 105\\xa0\\ncalories, 15 trillion Sahara bananas alone\\xa0\\xa0 could already feed the world’s population for\\xa0\\nover two months. For the world as a whole the\\xa0\\xa0 calories of all rain bananas add up to a grand\\xa0\\ntotal of 1.2 quintillion calories. With just\\xa0\\xa0 one day of banana rain we could go on feeding\\xa0\\neveryone on Earth for over a hundred years. Of course in reality, the banana\\xa0\\nrain would be pretty catastrophic. A banana falling from about 3000 meters,\\xa0\\nthe height of a mid-altitude rain cloud,\\xa0\\xa0 would reach a velocity of 240 meters per\\xa0\\nsecond and strike the ground with the same\\xa0\\xa0 kinetic energy you’d get from dropping a\\xa0\\nbowling ball off a 50 m building. And we\\xa0\\xa0 are dropping almost thirteen over eleven\\xa0\\nquadrillion of them across the planet. One of the rainiest and therefore worst affected\\xa0\\ncities is London. It would face a storm of 21\\xa0\\xa0 billion bananas, or 2.5 million tons. The shower\\xa0\\nof yellow death breaks roofs, shatters windows,\\xa0\\xa0 and decimates national monuments. Human\\xa0\\nbones are no match for this monsoon,\\xa0\\xa0 so we’d need to take shelter from the\\xa0\\nbanana blitz inside or underground. All around the world, cities and infrastructure,\\xa0\\nrivers and rainforests are severely damaged and\\xa0\\xa0 clotted with a layer of banana smoothie\\xa0\\nthat’s already beginning to rot. Trillions\\xa0\\xa0 of mashed bananas are floating in\\xa0\\nthe ocean, clogging up coastlines. Picture the aftermath of all the worst oil\\xa0\\nspills and superstorms combined but way\\xa0\\xa0 worse and kind of everywhere. And our problems\\xa0\\nare just getting started. The rotting banana\\xa0\\xa0 mush contains 160 billion tons of methane,\\xa0\\n280 times our current annual emissions as\\xa0\\xa0 a planet. Methane traps around 28 times more\\xa0\\nheat than CO2. Adding this much greenhouse gas\\xa0\\xa0 this quickly will lead to a catastrophic\\xa0\\nand sudden spike in global temperatures.\\xa0\\xa0 Most ecosystems won't be able to handle it and\\xa0\\nwe’ll witness a devastating mass extinction event. In short, Banana rain is an\\xa0\\napocalypse-level\\xa0catastrophe. Ok, hopefully your question has been properly\\xa0\\nanswered.

It feels like you stepped into an oven. There are no plants or any vegetation and almost no moisture in the air. The sunlight smashing down from the cloudless and weirdly colored sky is reflected by an endless sea of red and orange sandjunes stretching over the horizon for thousands of kilome. Dust devils the size of buildings dance over the hellish landscape. You're in the early Triacic hot house 250 million years ago, a few million years after the worst mass extinction in history. The planet is still suffering from a permanent fever. Volcanism and the runaway greenhouse effect has transformed the planet into hell. There's 3 to five times more CO2 in the air than in the human era. The formation of the massive superc continent pangia led to the largest desert in history that barely sees any rain. The gigantic ocean is warmed even deep below. Two superheated currents circulate around the globe, pumping extreme amounts of heat and moisture into the atmosphere. There's no ice even at the poles. Seems like you're stuck in the center of the desert, isolated by endless ancient land masses. One of the most hostile environments Earth has ever produced. The deserts we know are still full of life, but not this one. Its core is starved of moisture, and the air is bone dry. Your skin dries out immediately, and your lips begin to crack. The CO2 rich air is easily 50° C and sears your lungs with every labored breath. The rubber soles of your boots begin to melt. If you touch the ground, you'll get burns. Your sweat evaporates before it could cool you and your exposed skin begins to crack within minutes. Suddenly, it becomes even hotter as a red sandstorm envelops the landscape. Like thousands of tiny sparks, burning hot sand hits your skin. You're pressing your machine's buttons at random. It can't do time travel, but it can still move. You shoot over some of the mightiest mountains Earth has ever seen. Eventually, you stop at the shores of the Tethus Sea. The vast shallow ocean looks more like a swamp among scattered groups of waist high ferns and spindly stems with tufted foliage. A few lists feeding on them. Are you curiously? The water is murky and looks sickly and milky. Colorful mats of bacteria float on the surface like oil legs. The air is hot and humid like a steam room. It's hard to breathe and your sweat can't evaporate and cool you. Even the water can't give you any relief. It's as hot as a freshly run bathtub. This hot ocean can't hold much oxygen, especially in deeper layers. Bacteria and by valves are the only species that thrive here. The waves move almost sluggishly through this thick bacterial soup. When they break, they leave behind a glistening iridescent film. Each wave that hits the shore releases a mist that makes your eyes and throat burn, carrying the rotten egg stench of hydrogen sulfide up from the oxygen starved depths. Barely conscious from the heat and smell and CO2, you look at the horizon. The storm is building unlike any you've ever seen. The hot ocean feeds it endless energy. And with no continents to slow it down, it will dwarf the fiercest hurricanes of your time. You're doomed. Your broken time machine jolts and screeches. Something's happening. You're near the equator in the Lake Carboniferous 320 million years ago. The atmosphere is thick with moisture. The climate is locked in a neverending wet super summer without any other seasons. Colliding continents are covered by the largest swamps the planet will ever see. A paradise for plants growing faster than their dead biomass can decompose. The ground beneath is a warm, soggy mass of decaying vegetation. What will be an endless desert in 70 million years is now an endless alien jungle. A huge variety of life is thriving in this period. From your perspective, this is not that great. You're lost in a maze of giant treelike plants towering over a twisted undergrowth of giant ferns and endless varieties of bizarre and unfamiliar vegetation. The thick humid air smells of sweet decay, but breathing makes you dizzy. Your vision seems too sharp, your thoughts slightly frantic. The dense plant cover has supercharged the atmosphere with oxygen, 60% higher than in the human era, and your body is trying to cope, which is great for the dominant land animals, which have conquered every niche of this majestic garden. Bugs, you're stuck in the golden age of arropods. In this oxygenrich world, they have evolved to sizes that will never be possible again. They are innumerable and everywhere. Armored cat-sized mega crash through the undergrowth, hunting a swarm of paddock roids that scatter in all directions. Above you, a griffin fly with wings spanning nearly a meter and beating like helicopter blades catches a paleodict mid-flight. You stumble through the bushes filled with countless crawling creatures as an arthroplur the length of a car picks its way through the ferns, moving countless legs in hypnotic waves. You reach a swampy clearing and stumble into the shallow water, dizzy and terrified as a Pulman scorpius rips apart its prey, eyeing you with some interest. Here in the clearing, you can see the sky above the canopy glow shrieking red, intensifying at an alarming pace. The extreme humidity here creates sudden violent thunderstorms, and the oxygen-rich atmosphere makes everything dangerously flammable. Even the wet vegetation can burst into explosive flame with the slightest spark. Why do all of your trips end in a storm? Well, at least it will take all the creatures that want to eat you with it. Your broken time machine jolts back to life. The world is folding in on itself. You've woken up in the early Deonian 400 million years ago. Much of the planet is covered in shallow seas, while the land is mostly rocky plains and mountains broken by braided rivers and mud flats. Earth is in a state of transition. For about 100 million years, life has begun to break down rocks into soil, a soft layer that enables plants to grow and life thrive. The ozone layer is slowly building up, fed by organisms releasing gases. Recently, this process has been speeding up. The land is turning from toxic to semihabitable. The sky looks wrong somehow. The sun blazes harsh and white, barely filtered by the unfamiliar atmosphere. The air feels thin with only 15% oxygen compared to today's 21. Each breath feels shallow and unsatisfying. You're on the verge of passing out and can only move slowly. At least it's currently moderately warm and not stormy. But it's what dominates these lands that makes this world truly alien. Reaching up to 8 m into the sky are massive obelisks of fungal prototaxes. As you walk closer, you notice spores catching the sunlight, drifting through the air like tiny stars. Your movement disturbs more of them, creating clouds suspended in the thin atmosphere. They coat your skin with a fine, powdery, itchy film. You try not to think about how many you're inhaling with every breath in this oxygen poor air. The ground feels nothing like soil. It's mostly rock, partly covered by a thin, slightly springy layer of decomposing matter. Some shallow water pools reflect the pale alien sky above. Between the fungal towers, there's a carpet of smaller fungi and a few alien-like primitive plants. No flowers, no leaves, just strange green stalks and fern-like structures that reach your ankles. Around you, the fungal towers rise like pale pillars. Their surfaces, neither smooth nor rough, but something in between. They're neither wet nor dry, slightly yielding under your touch. Small patches of what might be lien, create splashes of muted greens and yellows on their surfaces. The only animals you can spot are a few insects burrowing into the large mushrooms. Everything is eerily quiet. You sit down on a rock. Is this it? As the night approaches, the pale sky shifts into sickly purples and grays bleeding into the darkness. No animal sounds announce the coming night, just the solemn whisper of the prototaxes creaking in the wind. Through the thin atmosphere, the stars in the Milky Way illuminate the scenery with unsettling clarity. The fungal towers loom as pale shapes against the starlet sky, their silhouette seeming even more wrong in the darkness. You are utterly alone, a time traveler lost in an alien [Music] world.

Welcome to the Courtz Kazak Lab. Let's conduct a few stellar experiments. We'll first add some more mass to this protoar. More? A bit more. Wow. We've just created a blue giant, a star with 10 times the mass of our sun. Let's now add a couple of million years and see what happens. A supernova. Breathtaking. And look, it leaves behind a black hole. Fascinating stuff. Now we record our findings. Be careful to preserve the sparkle. It's now time for Duck's final inspection. This one is always a nailbiter. He has incredibly high standards. Lucky for us, our work is scientifically accurate, offers an overview of important astrophysical processes, and is a real stunner. Duck approves.

[Music]\", 'n/a', 'n/a', \"South Korea is over. This sounds brutal, but South Korea will soon\\xa0\\nstart melting on all fronts –  demographically,\\xa0economically, \\n socially, culturally and militarily. Because for decades the country\\n has\\xa0been experiencing a fertility crisis unprecedented in human history. And we’ve probably reached a point of no return. By 2060, the South Korea we\\xa0\\nknow and love today will no longer exist. What will the collapse look like and\\xa0\\nwhy is it now almost impossible to stop? The (Real) Population Bomb To have a stable population you need\\xa0\\na fertility rate of about 2.1 children\\xa0per woman.  In the 1950s South Koreans\\xa0\\nused to have 6 children on average. In the 1980s the rate fell below 2. And\\xa0in 2023 it was 0.72 kids per woman,\\xa0\\n the lowest ever recorded in history. In Seoul\\xa0fertility is even lower, around 0.55. On average,\\xa0about half of the women here \\nwon’t have\\xa0any kids and the other half just one. What do these numbers actually mean in the\\xa0real world? If fertility stays as it is,\\xa0then \\n 100 South Koreans will have 36 kids. When they grow up, they will \\n have 13 kids,\\xa0who will then  have 5. Within 4 generations\\xa0\\n100 South Koreans will turn into 5. If we look at today's South Korean \\npopulation\\xa0pyramid we see this is pretty real:  There's\\xa0only one 1-year-old for four 50-year-olds. After 4 decades below the replacement \\n level,\\xa0the consequences were still largely\\xa0invisible. Today South Korea's\\xa0\\npopulation is at an all-time high, as are its workforce and \\nits GDP,\\xa0\\xa0which is still growing. But demographics\\xa0hits you like a freight train, you hear\\xa0it vaguely in the distance and then it runs\\xa0you over. South Korea is about to be hit. Let’s time-travel 35 years into the future, to 2060, and see what the\\xa0country will look like then. When it comes to demographics, the most\\xa0commonly used \\nprojections are those put\\xa0together by the UN. They envisage 3 scenarios:\\n low fertility, medium and high. But in the past,\\xa0all medium UN projections for \\n South Korea\\xa0have consistently been too positive. Between\\xa02022 and 2023 alone, \\n fertility in\\xa0South Korea dropped by another 8%. So we are going to use the\\xa0\\n latest low fertility scenario, which has been the most \\n accurate in the\\xa0last few years. Keep in mind that we\\xa0are still talking about projections and the future is a far away land. Ok! Let’s do it. In 2060 South Korea’s\\n population\\xa0pyramid will look like this: The population will have shrunk by 30%, 16 million\\xa0\\nSouth Koreans will have disappeared in just 35\\xa0years.  And it will be the oldest country in human\\xa0history. One in two South Koreans will be over\\xa0the age of 65. Less than 1 in 10 will be under\\xa025. And only 1 in 100 will be small children. Imagine waking up in a country where\\xa0the streets are strangely quiet with no children playing on them. Entire cities have been abandoned. Half of the population is elderly and\\xa0living \\neither alone or in overcrowded\\xa0retirement homes. With a minority of people\\xa0\\ndesperately trying to keep society running. There will be a few major consequences: Economic Collapse In 2023 a breathtaking 40% of South \\n Koreans\\xa0over 65 lived below the poverty line, but in 2060 this number \\n may seem lovely in comparison. Today South Korea has one \\nof the largest\\xa0pension funds in the world, worth about\\xa0$730 billion. But it is projected to stop growing\\xa0in the \\n2040s and be completely depleted by the\\xa02050s. So in 2060 pensions will have\\xa0\\nto be paid by the working population. Estimates vary, but for a pension \\n system\\xa0to work, the minimum a society needs is between 2 to 3 workers per \\n retiree paying for them with their taxes.\\xa0\\xa0 But even if we assume that all \\n South Koreans\\xa0over 15 will be working in 2060, the country\\xa0will have less than one worker per senior. Workers will be unable to stem the incredible\\xa0costs. So not only will poverty among the elderly\\xa0\\nbe common, but a big chunk will be forced to work. Except, they may not be able \\n to find jobs because\\xa0by 2060, the South Korean\\xa0\\neconomy may have collapsed. Broadly speaking, the size of an \\n economy is\\xa0linked to the size of its workforce – to have a\\xa0big economy you need \\n a lot of workers to produce a\\xa0lot of things, and a lot more people to buy them. Today, South Korea has about 37 million people\\xa0\\nof working age, generating a GDP of about $1.7\\xa0trillion. But by 2060 its workforce will have\\xa0\\nshrunk to less than half, to about 17 million. Of course technological progress \\n means\\xa0that productivity will be higher and each individual will \\n probably produce more\\xa0than today. But even if productivity keeps\\xa0growing at the \\n same rate or more than we’ve\\xa0seen in the last decades, South Korea’s GDP\\xa0could peak in the 2040s. In other words South\\xa0Korea will \\nenter a permanent economic recession. There are more optimistic projections \\n that see\\xa0the recession begin as late as 2050, but they\\xa0are based on the \\n medium UN demographic scenario – and there are no signs that we are heading there. Another factor in the economy is\\xa0\\n science, technology and innovation, areas in which big leaps are typically\\xa0\\nmade by young adults and the middle aged. Young people have fresh ideas \\n that\\xa0contribute to the wealth of society. Significantly fewer people working \\n also\\xa0means way less tax for the government, which will be trapped between a rock and a hard\\xa0place. On the one hand having to provide \\n for half the population that are seniors, on the\\xa0other seeing its income diminished. It will be\\xa0forced to shut down or cut \\n essential services like hospitals or social benefits. Since infrastructure\\xa0only works at \\n scale, smaller communities\\xa0may be abandoned as the country contracts\\xa0into its metropolitan areas. And of course there\\xa0won’t be \\n enough money to invest in the future. This is bad.  But what will happen to South\\xa0\\nKorean society and culture may be worse. Societal and Cultural Collapse Speculating on how \\n societies\\xa0will develop is extra hard, but there are a few pretty unavoidable trends. Today already about 20% of Koreans\\xa0live alone. Also 20% report having no close\\xa0friends or relatives. By 2060, 50% of South\\xa0\\n Koreans aged 70 will have no siblings and 30%\\xa0will have no children.  Young adults between 25\\xa0\\nand 35 will only make up 5% of the population\\xa0\\xa0 and typically have no siblings at all. This leaves the elderly with almost no close family, and young adults with little family and\\xa0\\n few potential friends, especially outside of big cities. \\xa0\\xa0 A loneliness epidemic of\\xa0\\nepic proportions is all but guaranteed. On top of that, South Korean culture will\\xa0\\nprobably experience a huge decline. In 2000\\xa0there were 17.5 million South Koreans \\n between 25-45, and they made up 37% of the population. This was the generation that\\xa0\\nbrought us K–pop, K-drama,\\xa0K-food, and many other trends that spread\\xa0around the world. In 2060 there will be\\xa0just \\n 5.6 million people in that age group, and they will only be 16% of the population. Many cultural traditions are already struggling because the older generations are having \\n trouble\\xa0finding young people to pass them on to. As young\\xa0people disappear, many traditions will die out. Without young people, the soul of South\\xa0\\nKorean culture will shrink and wither away. And on a personal level, what kind\\xa0\\nof experience will it be growing up\\xa0in 2060? What will youth culture \\n be like in a\\xa0country of seniors? Where many universities,\\xa0schools \\n and Kindergartens are abandoned as there are no longer children to fill them\\xa0with life? What kind of job prospects will\\xa0\\nthey face and what will politics look like? If young people don’t want to remain alone, they will concentrate in Seoul or a few\\xa0\\nother big cities – or worse for South Korea,\\xa0\\xa0 emigrate to other countries. Rural areas will\\xa0decline and most \\nsmaller cities will turn into\\xa0ghost towns –  we're already seeing this in\\xa0Japan, which has \\n almost 10 million abandoned\\xa0houses in rural areas. Large parts of South Korea\\xa0\\nwill simply vanish and be reclaimed by nature. Last but not least, South and \\n North Korea are\\xa0technically at war. And they could very well\\xa0still be in 2060. Will South Korea still\\xa0be able to afford to have its \\n young men\\xa0do 18 months of mandatory military service? Today 5% of men of combat \\n age are enrolled\\xa0in the military – in 2060 it would have\\xa0to be \\n15% just to match today's numbers. Ok, wait – this is all a bit\\xa0much. Is there no way back? Why There Really Is No Way Back The problem with the demographic freight \\n train\\xa0is that once it hits, things become irreversible. Let’s say fertility in South Korea magically\\xa0\\n triples to the replacement rate of 2.1 children\\xa0per woman and stays there. In 2060 it will\\xa0be an inverted pyramid on top of a barrel. And there would still only be 1.5 \\n people of\\xa0working age per senior over 65. Even in the best\\xa0made up scenario, South Korea has to pass through\\xa0\\n an unavoidable bottleneck before it will recover. But there is also a kernel of hope here. Yes, the\\xa0situation is grim. But at least in the long term, recovery is possible if South Korea enacts rapid and societal changes that make \\n its population want\\xa0to have kids again. In 2024 births rose for the\\xa0\\nfirst time in 9 years – 3% more than in 2023. But for that to continue, South Korea needs to face\\xa0\\nthe music and ask how they got to this point. How Could it get that bad? In general, as societies get richer, \\n more educated, and child mortality plummets, people decide to have fewer kids. What makes South\\xa0Korea special is that \\n it's somehow\\xa0supercharging all of these trends. South Korea lifted itself out of poverty in\\xa0\\nrecord time, but in doing so it developed a\\xa0unique kind \\n of workaholism and extreme\\xa0competitiveness. Although the work week\\xa0is 40 hours \\nand the legal maximum is 52 per\\xa0week,  unpaid overtime is normal for many and\\xa0the government even proposed \\n to raise\\xa0legal work time to 69 hours per week. Despite this, South Korea has relatively\\xa0\\nlow wages and a high cost of living. Real\\xa0estate in big cities \\n is out of reach for most\\xa0people. The cost of education is extremely high, since families have to pay for private lessons\\xa0\\n if they want to send their kids to a high tier\\xa0college. All of this while South Korea spends less\\xa0\\n on family benefits than most other rich countries. Old fashioned cultural \\n norms make matters even\\xa0worse. Marriage is all but mandatory \\n if a couple\\xa0wants to start a family –  in 2023 only 4.7%\\xa0of babies \\n were born to unmarried women. Out\\xa0of all developed countries, South Korean men\\xa0do just about the least share \\n of housework and\\xa0childcare within their families. This leaves\\xa0women with a \\n disproportionate amount of work if they want to keep their jobs after a\\xa0pregnancy. While many men are overwhelmed\\xa0by the \\n societal expectation to be the main\\xa0breadwinner and have successful careers. Starting a family or not is a personal decision. And most South Koreans are deciding against it. The bottom line is that South Korea has\\xa0\\ncreated a culture that leads to very few kids. Conclusion Demographic collapse is not an abstract \\n thing\\xa0in the future, it is happening right now. And\\xa0it is not just South Korea. In 2023 China had\\xa0a fertility rate of 1, \\n Italy and Spain 1.2, Germany 1.4, the UK 1.6 and the US 1.6 –\\xa0\\nwhich sounds so much better, doesn’t it? Well, after four generations, a fertility\\xa0\\nrate of 1.6 means 60% fewer new people. A fertility rate of 1.2 means 87% fewer people.\\xa0 And fertility rates are still falling, \\n\\xa0with no sign of stabilization or recovery. The weirdest thing about all of this is\\xa0\\nthat almost nobody involved in the public\\xa0discourse has truly grasped the gravity of\\xa0the situation. The last century was utterly\\xa0\\n dominated by overpopulation narratives and\\xa0people who say that \\n we need more kids seem\\xa0weird. And if you do the maths, the future\\xa0\\n just seems to be too insane to be true, like it's hard to believe. None\\xa0of this has ever happened before. So low birthrates are mostly \\n discussed in\\xa0the context of worker shortages – not the existential threat to our societies,\\xa0\\n cultures, wealth and our way of life that they\\xa0are. If we don’t take it seriously very soon \\n and\\xa0change the DNA of our modern societies in a way\\xa0that encourages young \\n people to start having\\xa0children again, then the rest of the century\\xa0will be pretty grim – for those of us who will\\xa0live through it. The demographic freight train\\xa0stops for nobody – we finally need to realize\\xa0\\nthat it’s hurtling down the tracks right at us. Multilayered issues like demographic\\xa0change are \\n hard to break through in our current media landscape  and easy to miss\\xa0out on. This is why we rely on Ground News,\\xa0 a long-time sponsor and ally in \\n helping find real\\xa0stories of importance  amongst the jumble of\\xa0\\ninformation we’re confronted with every day. In a nutshell, the app and website \\n gather\\xa0the world's news in one place so you\\xa0can compare coverage, see the \\n bigger\\xa0picture and make informed decisions. Using Ground News you can see that earlier this\\xa0\\nyear, South Korea was officially classified\\xa0\\xa0 as a superaged society, a term that basically\\xa0\\n summarizes the effects we described in this video. But less than 100 sources covered\\xa0this development. Interestingly,\\xa0less than 20% of them are left-leaning media. Ground News has a special feature, the\\xa0\\n Blindspot feed, that draws attention to\\xa0\\xa0 stories like that which get lost amidst\\xa0\\nyour personal publication preferences. Most importantly, you can clearly\\xa0\\n compare how the issue was covered:\\xa0 a government-funded source out of Slovenia\\xa0\\nfor example mentioned Europe is considering\\xa0\\xa0 immigration as part of a solution while \\n Korea,\\xa0Japan and China are avoiding that aspect.

It turns out your brain constructs\\xa0\\n your reality as you are experiencing it, it edits your memories as they happen,\\xa0\\xa0 it lives in totally different time spheres\\xa0\\nand tells you a story about the world that\\xa0feels real. What's going on and who\\xa0\\nis really in control of your life? The Gap Between Reality and You Vision is maybe our main source \\n of information\\xa0about the world – but in reality we don’t really\\xa0see that much. Only a thumbnail sized area\\xa0of \\n your visual field is in high resolution, while the rest is out of focus.\\xa0 If it doesn’t feel like this,\\xa0that’s because it is \\n made up by your\\xa0brain – using a pretty neat trick. Each second your eyes make 3 to 4 sudden\\xa0\\n jerky movements, saccades, of 50 milliseconds, focusing from one point to another. Scanning\\xa0your environment to get different \\n sharp images\\xa0that your brain then edits together. During a\\xa0saccade your brain shuts down \\n your vision so\\xa0you don’t see a wild motion blur. This means that\\xa0each day, for \\n around 2 hours, you're completely\\xa0blind. If you could actually see what your eyes\\xa0\\n see, it would look something like this:  brrrr brrrrrrrrr Instead your brain fills this time with its best\\xa0\\n guesses of what happened during the blackness.\\xa0\\xa0 But it does way more – it turns out that \\n you're not really experiencing time correctly. What's really happening when you \\n are stirring milk into a cup of coffee? As the spoon hits the ceramic, light\\xa0reflects \\n off it and hits your eyes\\xa0after 1.3 nanoseconds. The ceramic\\xa0vibrates and creates a shockwave\\xa0of air \\n molecules that travels to your ear in 1.2 milliseconds. Heat is picked\\xa0up by fibres in your fingers \\n that send a\\xa0signal to your brain in 50 milliseconds. Three very different inputs, all \\n processed\\xa0in your brain at different times. You don’t experience them separately but as \\n one\\xa0smooth, simultaneous and connected moment. Your brain takes a moment to process and\\xa0then \\n invents a reality, a present moment\\xa0that's not real. What you feel is “now” is\\xa0in fact a \\n selectively edited version of the\\xa0past.  You really only consciously experience the\\xa0\\n world 0.3 to 0.5 seconds after things happened. Except this is also not really true. Because\\xa0your brain is editing \\n time and space way\\xa0more than that. And it makes decisions\\xa0\\n completely out of your conscious control. You Are Living in the Past!  No,\\xa0future! No, a made up future! Your present, what you \\n experience\\xa0right now is kind of the future. Imagine for a second that you are a table tennis pro. In pro table tennis balls woosh around at\\xa025 meters \\n per second, which is pretty fast,\\xa0so let’s slow down time. Light passes\\xa0from the ball to your eye in nanoseconds,\\xa0\\xa0 is converted into electrical impulses that reach\\xa0\\n your brain to be processed after 100 milliseconds. Meanwhile, the ball travels 2.5 meters \\n through the\\xa0air, the length of the table. If your brain showed\\xa0you the past, where the ball was \\n 100 milliseconds\\xa0ago, it would hit you before you could react. So instead your brain takes\\n its location, speed and direction and calculates where the ball should\\xa0be in the \\n future – by the time the information\\xa0reaches you. And then it creates a fictional\\xa0version of it. This is what you see, in your fake\\xa0\\n present: a fake ball, that's somewhere else. But you don’t need to just see the\\n ball,\\xa0you want to smash it back hard. If you acted\\xa0now and started swinging your \\n arm you'd miss by a mile –  things are just too fast. So before the ball even touches your opponent's\\xa0bat, your brain starts predicting where \\n it will\\xa0\\xa0likely be in space after they hit. Based on the other player's \\n posture\\xa0and your table tennis experience. But as\\xa0it can’t be sure if it will be correct,\\xa0\\n it prepares multiple different responses. Maybe\\xa0the ball will be here, or here, or even here. To be ready for all of these scenarios \\n your brain\\xa0sends preprogrammed orders to the muscles you need\\xa0to jump left, right or up. Telling them to be\\xa0ready for \\n any of them at a moment's notice. For a short moment multiple\\xa0ghost versions \\n of you exist,\\xa0all equally real inside your brain.  And then,\\xa0as your opponent \\n is about to lay into the swing, your brain decides on a single \\n future that\\xa0it thinks is most likely.  All but one ghost\\xa0are deleted. You only ever experience the\\xa0\\n ghost that won, never the potential ones. The order to the muscles to act out the winning\\xa0\\nmovement is triggered, even before the ball is\\xa0hit back to you.  You are totally oblivious to this\\xa0– by the time you consciously see the ball\\xa0\\n coming at you and decide to hit it in a particular\\xa0way, your body has already hit it back. In reality your brain already\\xa0made all the decisions. Your\\xa0conscious experience is \\n nothing\\xa0more than an invented future, a prediction based on the information \\n your\\xa0brain received a fraction of a second ago. This is not just true for extreme sports\\xa0\\n like uhm ... table tennis, but also for walking. Walking is Time Travel After your game you are walking back home,\\xa0\\n seemingly choosing your path and reacting\\xa0to things. Meanwhile your brain is\\xa0operating in \\n three different time\\xa0spheres at once. It processes the sensory\\xa0feedback of the past, it calculates the\\xa0current state of \\n your body and it predicts\\xa0your future. Because walking is intense. Before the signal from your foot touching\\xa0\\nthe ground has even reached the brain, it's already sent the order to \\n your foot to make the next\\xa0step –  and it has already calculated\\xa0\\nthe muscle patterns for the next two. But what if something truly catastrophic happens? There's a banana peel and you step on it and slip –  how did it get here? Listen, don’t worry about\\xa0it. It turns out your brain is ready for this. So far we spoke of your “brain” making\\xa0\\ndecisions for you but this is not really\\xa0true. You don’t have a central control\\xa0\\nroom where the world comes together.\\xa0\\xa0 In reality different parts of your\\xa0body are\\n aware of different things,\\xa0at different times.  Your spinal cord usually knows\\xa0stuff before your brain. And even within your\\xa0brain different regions \\n process the same event at\\xa0different speeds and make independent decisions. As your foot catches the peel, the gyroscope\\xa0inside your\\n ears notices a sudden change\\xa0of your position in space. It submits this\\xa0information to \\n your brain stem and spinal cord, the “things must happen quickly” section\\xa0of your body. They immediately trigger\\xa0emergency recovery \\n patterns and send\\xa0orders to different muscle groups. Within 200 milliseconds pre-programmed \\n sequences\\xa0activate to catch your fall. Your arms shoot out,\\xa0\\xa0your other leg stiffens to support \\n your weight,\\xa0your core muscles contract to stabilise you. 100 milliseconds later, when you\\xa0become aware \\n that you are tripping,\\xa0your body is already recovering. You are only just now catching up. Ok, so we've learned that your brain is \\n constantly\\xa0predicting reality around you, makes decisions\\xa0about the best way to \\n act and then shows you\\xa0an edited version. Which totally makes sense,\\xa0would \\n you really want to be in charge\\xa0of that? But your brain is not just\\xa0predicting the external world. Right now it's predicting a way more complex thing: You. Are YOU just a Prediction of your Brain? Why do you feel about the world the way\\xa0you do? Your sense of hunger, your energy\\xa0\\n level and especially your emotions are not\\xa0just objective reactions to \\n what state you are\\xa0in, but predictions. Your brain's prediction of\\xa0what \\n you'll need soon or need to be ready for. You are probably used to getting food or \\n going\\xa0to bed roughly around the same time – and as time\\xa0approaches your brain \\n releases hormones to prepare\\xa0you. A self fulfilling prophecy. You get hungry\\xa0or tired because your brain \\n assumes this is the\\xa0time when this is needed. This is the most striking\\xa0thing about your emotions. They aren't just reactions to the \\n outside\\xa0world – they're predictions. When you go to a\\xa0party, your brain isn't \\n waiting to see how you\\xa0feel once you get there,  based on how the party\\xa0actually is. It analyses your experiences of past\\xa0\\n parties and who it expects to be there – maybe\\xa0close friends you feel safe around, maybe people\\xa0you don’t know \\n who are a less socially secure\\xa0bet. Maybe your brain remembers a party \\n where\\xa0you felt anxious, and that experience stuck. This could be pretty annoying – if your brain\\xa0predicts anxiousness, it adjusts \\n your heart\\xa0rate, hormone levels and muscle tensions before you even enter the room. It prepares\\xa0your body for anxiety, \\n making you actually\\xa0feel anxious. Which then confirms the brain's\\xa0\\n prediction and gets saved for future reference.\\xa0 Does this make you feel like \\n you are just along\\xa0for the ride, forced to experience whatever \\n predictions your brain feeds you?  Thankfully\\xa0it’s not quite like that. Your conscious self\\xa0is obviously not the \\n decider of most things as\\xa0you go through your day. But that is not what\\xa0it's good at anyway. Your brain and all of these\\xa0different \\n organ systems decide a lot of things, but they are more like butlers\\xa0\\n taking care of all the busy work. You may not be in the driver's seat, but you are\\xa0\\nthe passenger that decides where to go. What your\\xa0conscious self is good at is \\n long term planning\\xa0and abstract thinking. It's a storyteller that\\xa0tells the story \\n of your life to your brain\\xa0and to yourself – wherever the edges of these\\xa0\\n overlapping entities melt into each other.  \\nYou are able to see the big picture that your internal prediction \\n machine could never\\xa0begin to grasp. You are the part of you that\\xa0can edit \\n and write new predictions into the\\xa0system. Sometimes you and your brain \\n disagree\\xa0on what is correct –  but in the end you are the\\xa0person in power, \\n who tells the story about who\\xa0you are in this world.  A story so convincing\\xa0that you \\n experience it as undeniable reality. And as a happy accident, your conscious \\n self is great at being happy about ice cream, fascinated by internet videos and \\n thinking deeply\\xa0about pokemon types.\", \"what happens if the continents and oceans switch places oceans are way deeper than continents at all so just swapping the high and low points creates a result that's wet and boring let's drain 90% of the water so we can see the old coastlines again now we can explore this inverted World Pacifico a supercontinent 5times the size of Africa is home to the mighty Mariana mountains and their highest point Mount Challenger our lowest point ever as deep plunges almost 9 km below sea level and the Mid-Atlantic Canyon rips the world from pole to pole but what about life well the world's highest city is now the lowest Bolivia's El Alor is over 4,000 M below the waves most cities are completely flooded meanwhile our new oceans are a sludgy mess at first all this settlement provides A nutrient-rich Feast for marine survivors but islands like Fiji become landlocked lakes surrounded by vast deserts too big for rainclouds to cross many of these Lakes become saltier than the Dead Sea exposed corals bleach and once they've picked the carcasses clean bird staff still life finds a way in tiny footholds like inverted seamounts now high altitude craters in our new continents some like Hawaii's underwater volcanoes transform into impossibly steep valleys with tropical microclimates wait a few Millennia and evolution in these Cloud forests could produce some truly weird creatures but these small oases can't replace the massive oceans we got rid of they delivered half our oxygen and protected us from overheating without them the planet starts boiling air Runs Out out and we Face a global mass extinction yikes maybe we better leave things as they are\", 'n/a', 'This is not an anti meat video. We’ve all heard\\nthe arguments against meat, and yet, in the EU and US only between 1% and 6%\\nof people don’t eat it. Meat is just too tasty, convenient\\nand ingrained in our culture for most of us to consider giving it up. Also, food is personal\\nand nobody likes to be morally lectured. At the same time, we love animals. Most of us have pets\\nand believe in animal rights. Few things make the internet\\nas angry as animal cruelty. Both are true. We love meat and we love animals. Unfortunately, most animals we eat\\nlive in truly horrible conditions. We don\\'t torture them for fun, but because it makes meat\\njust a little bit more incredibly cheap. If we all paid just a tad more,\\nwe could avoid most animal suffering. Often just for a few pennies per meal. Disclaimer: farming is complicated. Many farmers are genuinely trying to give\\ntheir animals the best life possible, but they are trapped in a complex system with extreme market pressure\\nto keep prices low. No two countries have the same standards, no two farms are equal, and solid data is often scarce. We’ve done our best to combine data\\nfrom different regions and the prices you pay in the end. To keep things simple,\\nwe\\'re going to classify farming practices into three broad groups. Decent, prisons and torture camps. This is a bit sketchy, and you\\'ve probably seen\\nmany more categories in the supermarket, like \"organic\" or \"grass-fed\". We\\'ll come to that later. So, fellow omnivores, what would it cost us\\nto avoid animal torture and still have our fried chicken? [Chickens] At any given time, there are about 26 billion\\nchickens alive on Earth - as many as all other birds combined. Chickens seem dumb, but they are social, can communicate, solve problems\\nand feel empathy. And yet, we keep the vast majority\\nin insane torture. Let’s start with eggs. Worldwide, about 90% of laying hens\\nlive in torture camps - crammed in extremely tight cages\\nwhere they can barely move. They are unable to show\\nany natural chicken behavior like nesting, roosting, foraging\\nor pecking at the ground, so they become extremely frustrated and end up hurting each other badly. To stop this, many farms clip their beaks. In the US and Europe, legal bans and consumer initiatives\\nhave improved the situation a lot in the last few years. But still, more than 50% of hens\\nremain in cages. The insane thing is that this\\ndoesn’t even save a lot of money. Let’s say a dozen eggs costs you\\naround 3.60 euros or dollars - 30 cents per egg. How much does it cost to free the hens? The main alternative to cages\\nare “barn systems”. Hens are still kept indoors but have\\ntwice as much space and roam freely. Barns are prisons:\\nstill not amazing but so much better. In the EU, barns increase\\nthe consumer price by about… 2 cents per egg. The somewhat decent alternative\\nis “free range”, where hens are allowed outdoors,\\noften with proper access to vegetation. In the EU, this increases the price\\nby about 7 cents per egg. Housing aside, one of the cruelest\\npractices is chick culling. Male chicks don’t lay eggs\\nso they are killed right after birth, usually by gassing or grinding. This is a really widespread\\npractice used for caged, barn and even organic eggs. 7 billion baby chickens\\nare killed this way each year. France and Germany have banned this so many breeding eggs\\nhere are scanned early and only female birds hatch. Which may have increased costs\\nby only 2 to 5 cents per egg. So if you pay 85 cents more\\nfor a dozen eggs, you can make a difference\\nbetween serious chicken torture and pretty decent chicken lives. And for another 60 cents,\\nyou can help end chick culling too. Chicken meat is a different story. Most meat chickens today\\nare genetic freaks, bred to reach amazing weights\\nincredibly fast. Their internal organs\\nare under a huge amount of stress and they can’t even walk properly\\nbecause of their weight, which causes them a lot of pain\\nfor much of their lives. It is hard to give exact numbers here, but if farmers were to switch to breeds\\nthat grow slower and suffer far less, a serving of chicken breast\\nthat you buy at 1.5 dollars would become 9 cents\\nmore expensive in the US. 90% of meat chickens in the EU\\nlive in prisons or torture camps. They are kept indoors\\nin extremely crowded conditions, with sometimes dozens of birds\\nper square meter, often in the dark\\nand with poor ventilation. So what if we moved them all to prisons? One EU study found\\nthat giving them 30% more space, perches, fresh air and daylight would increase the price\\nby another 13 cents per serving. Probably less than 5%\\nof meat chickens live free range in relatively decent conditions. This meat is actually\\nnoticeably more expensive, double the price of “regular” chicken. But chicken is the cheapest meat. So depending on the cut, you\\'d pay 35 cents\\nto 1 euro or dollar more for a serving of chicken\\nthat had a decent life. [Pigs] Pigs are basically dogs. They are as intelligent, social\\nand playful as our wolf buddies and make lovable pets - so pigs really feel how they live and arguably have it the worst\\nof all animals we eat. Probably more than 90% of all pigs\\nlive in torture camps. They spend their entire lives indoors\\nin extremely crowded spaces, on concrete floors\\nwithout straw or bedding. Since this is far from what they need, they get frustrated and often fight. Piglets have their tails docked\\nto stop tail-biting. Most males are castrated after birth\\nso that their meat will taste better, often without pain relief to save time. Mothers are kept in “crates” - extremely tight metal straight jackets,\\nwhere they can’t move at all. This leads to extreme suffering\\nfor the mother and for the piglets, which are held in a barren area,\\nseparated by metal bars and taken away at just three weeks old. Imagine treating dogs like that. First, let’s get to the prison level. Getting rid of crates would raise\\nthe cost of a €2 serving of pork by about 20 cents. Anesthesia for castration\\ncosts almost nothing, around 1 cent per kilogram of meat. And a study in Denmark\\nfound that giving pigs more straw and bedding material and 30% more space and other things\\nthat are more animal-friendly would increase the price per serving\\nby another 20 cents. This is still an awful life\\nfor an animal this intelligent, but obviously much better. For 40 cents more per serving. Going one level further\\nand giving pigs outdoor access for at least 40% of their lives and 300-400% more space indoors would increase the price per serving\\nby another 80 cents. Just over 1% of pigs in the EU\\nlive in these or similar conditions. We can\\'t know if this is really okay\\nfor such a smart and social animal but it starts resembling something decent. And all for about 1.2 dollars\\nor euros more per serving of pig. [Cows] Cows raised for meat have it the best because they usually spend about\\ntwo thirds of their lives outdoors, making their lives pretty good. If they were in the wild, it would be\\nbasically the same thing but less safe. Their lives are far from perfect, though. Especially the end. The vast majority of cows spend\\nthe last months of their short lives in “finishing feedlots” - either prisons or torture camps where they are fattened to reach their\\nslaughter weight as fast as possible. Probably less than 5%\\nof beef cattle in the US have lifelong access to outdoor pasture. And yet, a recent German study found that it only increases\\nthe price of beef by around 15%. The life quality of cows varies widely\\neven within countries and regions, depending on the available land,\\nclimate and farming traditions. So it\\'s really impossible to make\\nmore easy and cheap suggestions to make their lives better. Dairy cows do have it much worse. They are often kept indoors\\nfor most of the year and suffer pain, sole ulcers and lesions\\nfrom standing on concrete. But once again, none of these things\\nseem to be needed to have affordable milk. In Germany, outdoor pasture\\nincreases the price of the milk by about 10 cents per liter. We could go on with many other animals\\nand farming practices, but the summary is clear. For the animals we eat the most,\\nupgrading their living conditions from outright torture to somewhat decent may cost you about 15% more\\nfor beef and milk, 50% for eggs and pork, and 100% for chicken meat. [The meat of the issue - Opinion part] Meat has gotten so cheap that we have to torture animals\\nto keep the prices insanely low. This really is all there is to it. Food in developed countries\\nis the cheapest it\\'s been in history. In the US, the largest\\nmeat consumer in the world, an average person\\nspends $337 a month on food. $88 on meat, eggs and dairy. If these became on average\\n50% more expensive, that would increase the monthly\\nexpenditure on food by about $43. This may sound like a lot,\\nbut, relative to income, this only means paying as much for food\\nas US consumers did in 1987. In Germany, the average person\\nspends about €70 a month on meat, eggs and diary. If we increased prices by 50% on average to make the lives of these animals\\nbetter in a really meaningful way, this would rise by about €35,\\nto about €100. If this still sounds too expensive, it may be because around 20%\\nof all meat people buy is simply thrown away. Meat got so cheap that we often don\\'t eat it\\nbefore it goes bad. It\\'s no longer valuable. Okay, so if you go shopping,\\nwhat can you do? It can feel like you can\\'t do anything\\nas an individual consumer, but this is not true. The market follows demand. So if you don\\'t want to buy torture meat, look at the labels on holding conditions. If there is none,\\nit is torture meat for sure. If there is, well, it\\'s complicated. It\\'s often unclear\\nwhat different labels mean. If they\\'re strictly enforced\\nor legally binding. Some are great, others whitewashing. And we haven\\'t talked about\\nthe most expensive meat so far: organic meat. You\\'ve probably noticed that many\\nprice estimates we\\'ve given here don\\'t quite match your experience\\nin the supermarket. This is in part because some retailers\\nconsider ethical products luxury goods and charge an even higher price. And also because many labels\\nlike \"organic\", \"natural\", \"ecological\", \"bio\",\\nor the worst of all, \"biodynamic\", often contain a lot of extras\\nor pseudo-signs that have nothing to do\\nwith animal welfare. Many but not all of these labels include some of the best practices\\nmentioned before, but not necessarily all. Organic brands often include,\\nfor a lack of a better word, stupid measures, like forbidding GMO feed. As we covered in another video, banning GMOs doesn\\'t do anything good\\nfor you or the animals. It just makes your food more expensive\\nand seem more \"natural\" while you are consuming\\nunnatural animal breeds living a deeply unnatural life. Unfortunately, the label situation\\nin many countries is extremely confusing, often on purpose. All too often we don\\'t know\\nwhat we\\'re really buying. So, grudgingly, if you can afford it and want at least a high chance\\nof torture free meat, go for the label. If you can afford it, buy organic. If you can afford it and have time,\\nresearch local farms and get your meat\\nfrom a place you\\'ve seen yourself. There is one exception\\ntoo good not to mention. Mussels. They suck up carbon and filter water,\\nmaking coastlines cleaner. Calling mussels dumb\\nis giving them too much credit. With no central nervous system,\\nand probably no thoughts or pain, they are basically moss. Really, everyone should eat more mussels. Okay, let\\'s wrap up. You don\\'t need to be vegan to think\\nthe current situation is unacceptable. The conditions of most animals we eat\\nare hard to stomach, and could all be avoided if we paid\\nas much for meat our parents did. Things are slowly getting better,\\nat least in the West. Consumers can push the industry\\nin the right direction if we bite the bullet and pay more. If you can\\'t afford this,\\nmaybe eat a bit less meat. Don\\'t throw meat away. Maybe avoid the worst\\ntorture meat, like pork, at least sometimes. And push for legislation that bans\\nthe most horrific practices. We can help make the lives of billions\\nof animals dramatically better. It really is that simple. You can only advocate for better policies\\nif you have enough reliable information. When financial incentives are prioritized, facts can be manipulated\\nor even omitted altogether. In 2024, many major\\nfast food chains backtracked on serving chicken\\nthat\\'s free from antibiotics, and do use it on sick chickens now. But is this the full story?

We know that life on Earth\\nis incredibly diverse and exists in the strangest\\nand most extreme places. From blue dragon sea slugs to aye-ayes, or Chrysomallon snails\\nwith shells of iron. Or whatever this is supposed to be. Let's use our imagination and real science to travel to three possible worlds, each more alien than the next. Put on your future-science suit, and enter the portal to witness wonders\\nnever seen before. [The eye of Oculus] This is the red dwarf star Oculus. Five times smaller than our Sun\\nand a lot less bright. A bit larger than Earth\\nbut orbiting its star 20 times closer, you see the ice hell of the planet Ipa. It's tidally locked, so one side experiences\\na never-ending night and the other an eternal day, lit by the star's dim glow. In the region facing\\nthe dim star directly, temperatures are warm and pleasant. The hell of ice has melted\\ninto a shallow black ocean: the Eye of Ipa. About the size of Europe, barely 200 meters at its deepest points, churned by a never-ending storm where hot air meets the frigid winds\\nfrom the icy outskirts. But below this inhospitable chaos\\nwe find calm stability, an ecosystem in almost perfect balance. Let's dive in. Instead of meeting open water we splash into a floating\\nunderwater jungle. We know places like this at home: kelp forests made from seaweeds\\nup to 65 meters long, sheltering countless smaller creatures. On Earth we get abundant white sunlight\\nso our plants evolved to be green, absorbing the most useful\\nred wavelengths for photosynthesis and reflecting away the rest. But Oculus shines not nearly as bright and its dim rays are even\\nfurther dulled by the storm. So here plants are a deep black to make use of the weak\\ninfrared leftovers. Which also gives the Eye of Ipa\\nits striking black color. Over billions of years, the jungle has occupied\\nall possible space in the Eye. Its roots extend deep into the seabed mud, anchoring them and providing\\naccess to nutrients. They drop their seeds\\nin the few free spaces in the mud. Only death makes room for new life. Big and streamlined teardrop-shaped\\ncreatures push through the dark water. They kind of look like… fish? Just like many sea creatures on Earth, their shape is optimized for the lowest\\ndrag when traveling through water. Like underwater cattle, they lazily swim through the forest, grazing on leaves in peace. Suddenly, a patch of strange\\nlooking leaves begins to move and wraps around a distracted grazer, dragging it down into hungry jaws. A predator that's had eons\\nto adapt its camouflage to fool its prey. But not only by imitating leaves. Both hunter and prey never evolved eyes in this dark underwater murk. Instead, they do battle\\nwith sounds and textures. Listen. There's a whole cacophony down here. Countless species\\nare singing to each other, sending warnings or invitations, forming a collective song. Like the noisy jungles of Earth, except Howler Monkeys and screaming pihas are replaced by chattering Seed-Eaters poking at the mud with snapping pincers, squeaking Spike-Bulbs loaded with poison, and the flailing fins\\nof starfish-shaped Grabbers hunting small prey. Beautiful! And unsettling. In this stable\\nand never-changing ecosystem, their music will never end\\nfor billions of years. You seem to have been noticed and Blind Creepers\\nare crawling towards you. You want to explore this world,\\nnot become part of it. So it's time to leave. [The clouds of Nimbus] You're immersed in the blinding light of the B type star Caeruleus, shining hot and blue, orbited by a dozen lava planets\\nburned to a crisp. But we'll visit the last planet: Nimbus, a gas giant very much like Neptune\\nin size and composition, except there's a lot more water and seething hot Caeruleus showers it with 900 times more light than Neptune. So its atmosphere is warm enough for gigantic white clouds\\nthe size of countries, to be lofted upward\\nby titanic warm updrafts rising from the hazy depths. Millions of years ago,\\nand astonishingly quickly, life emerged and evolved\\ninside tiny water droplets deeper down in the planet. Like extremophile microbes on Earth, they found ways of breathing methane and using exotic enzymes to harvest sulfur and nitrogen\\ncompounds from the air. As Caeruleus grew hotter and brighter, the higher altitudes of Nimbus\\nbecame habitable and life spread. Let's dive into to the gigantic\\nwhite clouds to meet it. Up here live quadrillions of tiny beings, a kind of cloud plankton so small they're carried\\non the gentlest air currents. The most common type resembles\\nflat four-legged spiders barely a millimeter wide, tinted yellow by the sulfur they consume. They gain lift with wispy\\nelectrostatic threads, thinner than spider silk, pulling on the charge differences between\\nthe top and bottom of the cloud oceans. A technique Xysticus crab spiders use to travel great distances on Earth. You're just in time for mating season. Billions of cloud plankton\\ngather to join their threads into huge parachutes that ride updrafts for hundreds of kilometers. Here in the hot heights, they hatch their eggs\\nbefore their life comes to an end. Other tiny creatures latch on, most of them predators looking\\nto feast on fresh younglings. But not all life on Nimbus is tiny. The other way to stay up\\nin the sky forever is to become a living balloon. Like the enormous Sky Whales,\\ntaller than a skyscraper, almost completely made\\nof a wafer thin membrane. They heat up trapped gases, making them less dense\\nthan the air around them, giving them buoyancy. The bigger their gas envelope,\\nthe more lift it produces, so Sky Whales evolved\\nto be as large as possible. Only a lumpy car-sized\\nspherical bag of organs hangs at its bottom. Heating up all this gas\\nrequires a lot of energy, so it is time to feed. The spherical body opens up, unfolding and lowering a huge\\nsticky net into the white clouds. On Earth the largest animals\\nto ever exist, blue whales, feed by filtering millions\\nof tiny krill each day. Similarly, the Sky Whales of Nimbus filter sky plankton out of the clouds. Most is consumed right away and burned in specialized\\nglands to generate heat. The rest is converted into an orange\\nand energy dense nectar for later. This nectar is the most valuable\\nresource on Nimbus. Numerous predators are looking for it, but none so hungrily\\nas the frog sized Jet Squids, evolutionary cousins of the whales. Several of them trail each Sky Whale waiting for it to be distracted\\nor sleepy after a succulent meal. Jet Squids are far less\\nefficient floaters. But they are able to superheat\\nand expel gases in short bursts, like a rocket. Like vampiric hummingbirds, their long and pointy beaks\\ntry to pierce their prey and lap up some of the nectar inside. Unlike in the stable Eye Ipa, life on Nimbus is doomed. B Type stars like Caeruleus live for a few hundred\\nmillion years at most and this time is coming to its end. Soon it will be burning through its fuel\\nat an astounding rate and violently burn our gas giant. Life on Nimbus is only\\n600 million years old and has barely ten million years left. Is this tragic? Or is this unique ecosystem lucky\\nto have existed in the first place? Something to ponder as you move on\\nbefore your jetpack runs out of fuel. [A fatal attraction] Orsted is a Y-class brown dwarf 13 times more massive than Jupiter and with a magnetic field\\n60 times stronger. It belongs to yellow star Sturgeon, which is about to disappear\\nbehind Orsted’s shadow. But you are interested in Monnier,\\none of Orsted’s many moons. It should get as much\\nsunlight as our Earth, but its 3 hour orbit\\naround the brown dwarf means its days are extremely short. Gravity here is a mere 5% of Earth’s, so the moon can only hold\\nonto a thin carbon dioxide atmosphere that doesn’t retain much heat. So, its average temperature\\nis far below freezing. As its cold night begins,\\na chill descends on Monnier and dry ice snows from the sky. A green, blue and red aurora\\nilluminates the landscape, made from star plasma caught\\nin Orsted’s magnetic field and striking Monnier’s atmosphere. The Sturgeon system was born\\nfrom a nebula saturated with metals, so iron and lead are abundant. In this frigid cold,\\nchock-full of toxic minerals, life found unique ways\\nto make the best of a bad situation: by using ammonia instead of water, which would freeze in the short nights. And by incorporating magnetized minerals and Orsted’s magnetic field\\ninto its biology. On Earth species like lobsters or bees have learnt to sense magnetic fields, but life on Monnier\\ntakes it to a whole other level. As Sturgeon rises and its red rays\\nfilter through Orsted’s crescent, a yellow glow rushes over the horizon. The snowfall stops\\nand temperatures quickly rise. The ground creaks\\nand multi-colored liquids trickle out from fissures all around you: cryovolcanism just like\\non Jupiter’s moon Europa. Brittle-seeming bundles start to unspool and climb off the ground,\\ntowards the bright star. Like Arctic flowers on Earth\\nsprouting in the short summer, these plants don’t have\\na minute of daytime to waste. Their blossoms are saturated\\nwith magnetic minerals, making use of the extreme magnetism\\nand low gravity to levitate, reaching up to a kilometer into the sky. Extending the sunset\\nfor as long as possible. Hey, don’t touch them! With a loud crack, the skyflower\\ndetaches itself from the ground and drifts out of reach. Suddenly you are surrounded. Hundreds of shiny critters zoom by. They look like ice-skating snails and can circle Monnier\\nfaster than the sunset. From their head\\nthey extend two long stalks that are electrically-conductive\\nand merge up top. A magnetic kite that drags them\\nalong the surface at breathtaking speeds. The Skaters formed\\na symbiotic relationship with photosynthetic purple microorganisms that live in their shells. These biological solar panels produce sugars that they share\\nwith the skaters in exchange for continuous starlight. If the skaters ever stop they risk their partners freezing and death by starvation. The harmonic scenery\\nis violently interrupted as the ground splinters open and a spiked metal claw\\ngrabs a Skater and crushes it. It belongs to an animal that looks like\\na cross between a sea-lion and a beetle. As it devours its prey, it gets covered\\nin pink and sparkly fluids. These Ambushers hide\\nin the crystalline ground, spreading an array\\nof electrically sensitive whiskers that they use to detect their prey\\nand strike just as they zoom by. Like living landmines\\nthat could be buried everywhere. Maybe you should end your stroll. The darkness will return soon. It's time to return home. [Back home] Earth, warm and pleasant. It's good to be home, in the environment you and all other life\\nthat's not made up evolved in. But, who knows, if you look up at the countless\\nflickering lights there may be countless strange worlds home to life stranger\\nthan anything you've seen. Scientific speculation is fun\\nbut also useful, giving us ideas about\\nwhat we should look out for and, who knows,\\nmaybe in a few thousand years our descendants may actually\\nvisit exotic oceans, fly over white clouds\\nthe size of continents or pet metallic animals. And maybe, just maybe, even talk to others like us who are also marveling at all\\nthe strange life in our universe.

been sweeping across Wildlife populations in Europe This was bad news since rabis can spread to pets and then to humans it attacks the brain and leads to symptoms like confusion aggression and paralysis once you got it back then the infection was 100% deadly the epidemic had to be stopped the main carriers of the virus were red foxes which were now hunted excessively either with rifle or by releasing poisonous gas into their Burrows but it soon became clear that this was counterproductive hunting caused the fox populations to migrate spreading the virus even further catching foxes alive and vaccinating them one by one proved too slow and expensive finally in 1978 a somewhat Bonkers idea was tested blisters filled with a vaccine were put into thousands of chicken heads that were left over from slaughter houses they were then tossed onto Pathways and roadsides and dropped from helicopters in areas that were more difficult to access the method worked up until 1991 vaccinated chicken heads were distributed in Europe over a total area larger than 33,000 football fields and as Chicken Heads dropped so did the numbers for rabis cases in Europe since the early 90s several countries have even been declared rabis free the method is still used today in 2021 rabis vaccine baits intended for raccoons were dropped from helicopters over Cape Cod although nowadays industrially

An allergy is like finding\\na spider in your bedroom and exploding a nuclear bomb. Sure, spiders are upsetting and now dead, but so are all of your\\nneighbors and your dog. You can be allergic to an incredibly\\ndiverse and weird amount of stuff: pollen, dust, insect stings, animal hair, any kind of food, latex and even your own sweat. One of the wildest things about allergies\\nis how fast they are, breaking out suddenly and violently. And you can develop new allergies. One moment you\\'re enjoying a shellfish\\nyou ate thousands of times before, and the next moment\\nyou wake up in an ambulance. A shrimp can kill you. How bizarre! But, like, what are allergies? Why do our bodies flip the table\\non harmless stuff? There\\'s a wild and interesting idea\\nwe want to share with you. Humans might have created\\nallergies by accident by getting rid of worms. [This is very upsetting and interesting] For your ancestors,\\nbeing infected by worms was a reality of life. We won\\'t get into the disgusting details, but in a world where drinking water\\nand our poo were close buddies, some species of worms found\\njust the perfect cycle of life. They enter your bodies with the water\\nand make themselves at home, sometimes for decades, and then release their eggs\\nor larvae with your poo, which used to go back\\nto the water we drank. So, until recently, in evolutionary terms, our ancestors had to deal with frequent\\nor permanent worm infections. This caused all kinds\\nof unpleasant health effects. Our immune system\\nhad to find weapons to get rid of them. But how do you do that? From the perspective of a cell, worms are cities-scale kaiju\\nreaching beyond the horizon. Worse, instead of skin, parasitic worms have\\nan elastic protective layer that withstands even stomach acid. You really need to pack\\nsome punch to cause damage. It takes an army to kill a worm. We\\'re simplifying but, basically, when a worm enters your body\\nfor the first time, intelligence cells notice their presence. They move to your lymph nodes and activate specialized\\nantibody factories called \"B cells\". We explain them in detail in this video. These B cells are told\\nthat they need to fight parasites and start producing\\na special class of weapons, IgE antibodies tiny protein crabs with two pinches that connect to worms\\nlike magnets to metal. IgE floods your entire body and basically begin arming a nuclear bomb, an army of really scary cells\\ncalled \"mast cells\". Mast cells are huge bloated fellows filled to the brink with histamine\\nand other nasty chemicals. They pick up the IgE floating around\\nand cover themselves with them like angry Hedgehog Grenades\\nwithout their safety pins. And then they just lie and wait, angrily. So now you have millions of bombs, in your skin lungs or gut. Until the day the mast cells meet a worm trying to enter your body. There\\'s not much time to get rid of it\\nso things escalate rapidly. The mast cells with their IgE spikes\\ngrab onto the worm particles and… kind of explode. They release all of their dangerous\\nchemicals all at once. A few things now happen\\nin rapid succession. First, some of the mast cell chemicals\\nwound the worms, ripping wounds into them\\nand making them really unhappy. Then emergency chemicals like histamine\\ncause massive and rapid inflammation ordering your blood vessels\\nto flood the battlefield with water to flush the worms out. They also order your cells\\nthat make mucus to go into overdrive and cover the worms in sticky slime. Other chemicals are like air raid sirens, screaming loudly throughout your body for anti-parasite soldiers: eosinophils. First thousands, then hundreds\\nof thousands hear the alarm leave your blood vessels to where\\nthe mast cells are causing inflammation. Not only do they make\\nthe inflammation worse, they carry extremely toxic chemicals\\nthat they vomit at the worm, ripping open its defensive layer\\nand causing horrible injuries. Sometimes this will\\nstraight up kill the parasite. Lastly the anti-worm coordination\\ncell arrives: the basophil. It makes sure that the immune system\\ndoesn\\'t slow down but keeps attacking with violence. It keeps the inflammation going and alerts more and more attack cells\\nto the sight of battle. Zooming out, we see that the chemicals\\nfrom your anti-parasite forces make your smooth muscles contract rapidly, pushing everything that\\'s inside, outside. In your intestines,\\ncombined with all the water, you notice this as diarrhea. as your body tries to expel\\nthe stressed parasite. In your respiratory tract\\nloads of mucus and water flood outside trying to take the worm with them. If this happens under your skin, your tissue is red, hot and itchy as your immune system\\nis trying to commit murder. It takes a fierce army to kill a worm and your anti-parasite forces\\nhave the license to act rapidly and with intense violence. Okay, this is nice and all, but what does all this have to do\\nwith killer shrimps? [What is an allergy?] Parasitic worms don\\'t love\\nbeing ripped apart by millions of bombs, and as all living things do, they adapted to the deadly\\nattacks on them. In a nutshell, worms release\\na plethora of chemicals to manipulate your immune system. They make it weaker and much less angry like immune system weed. Which is pretty bad for your survival because you have to fight off\\nall sorts of intruders every day. Our ancestors were basically unable\\nto prevent regular worm infections, so, as the worms adapted to us, our bodies had to adapt to them. To balance out\\nany weakening worm chemicals, one adaptation might have been\\nto make our immune system more aggressive so it could still defend\\nagainst other invaders. And then, a hot second ago\\nin evolutionary terms, everything changed. We suddenly invented soap and hygiene\\nbut, most importantly, the separation of poop and drinking water. This destroyed the life cycles\\nof parasitic worms and the ones that remained\\nwere eradicated by modern medicine. Worms still infect up to 2 billion people, mostly in undeveloped rural regions or slums with unsanitary conditions\\nand dirty water. The people who escaped these conditions\\nnow face an interesting problem. An immune system without a major enemy that had kept it down\\nfor millions of years. It could very well be\\nthat our immune system still operates assuming\\nthat worms are making it weaker, and that it has to be\\noverly aggressive because of that. And while IgE, mast cells, basophils and eosinophils\\nalso have other jobs, a major reason for their existence\\nhas now gone away. But they kind of act\\nas if worms are around, only that they now attack other\\ndangerous foes, like shrimps. This is exactly what happens when\\nyou have an allergic reaction to a shrimp. Your immune system\\npicks up shrimp proteins and produces IgE antibodies\\nagainst shrimps. The antibodies then arm mast cells,\\nturning them into bombs. So you have millions of bombs\\nin your skin, your lungs or your gut with a license to choose violence,\\neven when provoked a little bit. Until one day you eat another shrimp, your anti-parasite forces\\nflip on like a switch. Only there is no kaiju to attack. This is what you experience\\nwhen you have an allergic reaction. Extremely powerful weapons\\nnow target your own body. Under your skin, your blood vessels\\nsuddenly turn leaky. Fluid streams into your tissue, your skin swells up and turns red,\\noften in itchy hives. You immediately feel hot and unwell. In your digestive system, the mast cells can cause nausea,\\ncramps and sharp pain as water floods into your intestines and triggers intense\\ndiarrhea and vomiting. Your respiratory tract swells up\\nmaking breathing hard. Way more dangerously,\\nhistamine and other chemicals can cause the smooth muscles\\nin your lungs to tense up. In the best case, you get a stuffy nose. In the worst case,\\nyou\\'re suddenly fighting for your life. Mast cells all over your body\\nunload their bombs all at once, causing an anaphylactic shock. Your blood loses so much water that your blood pressure\\ndrops to dangerous levels. This alone is life-threatening. In combination with the things\\ngoing on in your lungs, anaphylaxis is a life or death emergency, often with just a small time window\\nto do anything about it. Allergic reactions truly are no joke. Even the deadliest diseases like Ebola\\nneed days to kill you, but your immune system\\ncan kill you within a few minutes. And this is why a shrimp can kill you. Because, on a fundamental level,\\nan ingenious defense system, vital for our species survival\\nfor millions of years, is fighting imaginary kaijus. Yet we still don\\'t know why some people produce a lot of IgE antibodies\\nagainst certain substances and others don\\'t. We don\\'t know why some adults\\ndevelop new allergies later in life or why some allergies disappear over time. And we\\'re not sure if the lack\\nof worms is the main culprit, only that the cells\\nthat evolve to fight them are responsible\\nfor the symptoms of allergies. There are other ideas,\\nlike less diverse microbiomes or increased pollution. Maybe it\\'s just a combination\\nof all of them. But what we clearly see is that allergies and their more serious cousin,\\nautoimmune diseases, have been rising massively\\nin the last 100 years. Wherever humans moved\\ninto more sanitary conditions and got rid of some\\nof the horrible parasites hunting us. Hopefully we\\'ll figure it out\\nand prevent allergies forever Because one thing\\'s for sure: we don\\'t want to get worms back. That would really be like finding a spider and exploding a nuclear bomb. GiveWell wants as many donors as possible to make informed decisions\\nabout high impact giving.

Based on long-term trends\\nin the last century, it seemed violent conflict\\nwas on the decline and the world more peaceful than ever. Our video began with\\nthe Russian invasion of Ukraine and the war between Hamas and Israel. And, well, a decade later we could start this video\\nexactly the same way. But is the world as a whole\\nmore violent today? In a nutshell,\\nwe made seven claims in 2014. One, we have less\\nconflict deaths than ever. Two, there were almost\\nno more wars between countries. Three, democracies don\\'t fight each other. Four, borders are mostly fixed. Five, most conflicts are in areas\\nthat were under foreign control, either by colonial states\\nor Soviet dictatorships. Six, more civil wars\\nare ending by diplomacy. Seven, we\\'re in the most\\npeaceful period of history. So, let\\'s see how our video has held up. First, let\\'s get an overview\\nof conflicts in the last decade. Some of the deadliest conflicts\\nthat were glowing hot in 2014 have since ended\\nor significantly cooled down. The war in Afghanistan ended\\nwith the victory of the Taliban. While the civil wars in Yemen\\nand Libya are all still ongoing, they turned mostly into stalemates. The protostate of ISIS in Iraq\\nand Syria has been wiped out and, breaking news, the rebels just won\\nthe war in Syria last week. The extremely destructive civil war\\nin South Sudan ended in a fragile peace agreement despite violence still flaring up\\nin the devastated young country. Sadly, the last decade\\nsaw a bunch of new conflicts erupt or old unresolved issues turn violent. One of the main claims\\nof our video 10 years ago was that wars today\\nare not between countries, and this is still largely true. Civil wars are by far the most common type\\nof state-based conflict in the world. We wager that most of you\\nhave never heard about one of the deadliest\\ncivil wars in decades: The 2020 Tigray war in Ethiopia. It ended in 2022 with the victory of the Ethiopian\\nand Eritrean government forces against rebel groups. Exact death tolls are unknown but they may exceed half a million,\\nmostly civilians. Aside from Tigray, a number of new civil wars\\nhave broken out since 2014, although \"new\" is a bit misleading since the underlying issues were brooding\\nat a smaller scale for a long time. The deadliest have been\\nthe Sudan civil war, the civil war in Yemen\\nand the civil war in Myanmar. Multiple nations in Africa\\nlike Mali, Nigeria, Somalia, Burkina Faso and Mozambique are suffering from islamist insurgencies\\nthat destabilize countries and have cost tens of thousands\\nof civilian lives. Lastly, there are nearly 60 smaller unresolved state-based conflicts\\naround the world, many going on for decades\\nthat are smoldering but have a relatively low\\ndeath toll in comparison. Maybe the worst news is that\\nwe\\'ve been seeing interstate wars again. There was the short-lived 2020 war\\nbetween Azerbaijan and Armenia which redrew contested borders. Then there\\'s the latest war\\nbetween Israel and Hamas that turned into a regional crisis. What is certainly\\nthe most disturbing new development is the full-scale invasion\\nof Ukraine by Russia. It\\'s the first large-scale\\ninterstate war in 20 years and the first war since World War II where a major power\\nis trying to conquer territory and to subjugate another state. It followed an 8-year conflict that started with the 2014\\nRussian annexation of Crimea and the war in the Donbas. Exact casualty rates for the war\\nsince 2022 are hard to verify but they go as high\\nas hundreds of thousands. Okay, so what about our 2014 claims? If we add up the numbers,\\nwe see a few things. Roughly, between 2004 and 2014 there were about 350,000 deaths\\nfrom state-based conflicts worldwide. They were going down from 2014 to 2019 and then rose sharply in 2021. In total, from 2014 to 2024, we saw about 1.2 million deaths. If we include all violent conflicts\\nlike the Mexican drug war, the number rises to 1.5 million, three times higher\\nthan the previous decade. Actually, 2022 had the highest\\ndeath toll from violent conflict since the Rwandan genocide in 1994. The Tigray war\\nand the war in Ukraine alone were responsible\\nfor the majority of lives lost as both wars involved armies\\nof hundreds of thousands of soldiers, sometimes thrown against\\nentrenched positions in human wave attacks. So, the last 3 years\\nhave been unusually violent, but if we zoom out a bit more,\\nwe can put those numbers into perspective. A terrible thing, but nowhere near how bad it can get\\nwhen the world goes to war. In the grand scheme of things, we are still living\\nin relatively peaceful times, but the next decade will show\\nif the trend will reverse or if the last few years were an anomaly. Unfortunately, there have been\\nproper wars between states again so our prediction on wars\\nbetween countries didn\\'t hold up. What is as true today as in 2014, is that almost all armed conflicts\\nin the world are in countries that were under foreign occupation\\nin the 20th century, either by colonialism or by the expansive Soviet dictatorship. Ethnic groups were split apart\\nor forced together by arbitrary borders, resources unequally distributed\\nor power vacuums created, which led to conflicts\\nthat are in many cases still unresolved. There have also been no wars\\nbetween democracies, who seem uniquely unwilling\\nto fight each other. So, compared to the last century, it\\'s still true that war between nations\\nis still an exception rather than the rule. On the other hand, we see fewer\\ncivil wars end by diplomacy. Instead there\\'s an increase\\nin either victories or stalemates. These often aren\\'t permanent\\nresolutions to the conflict, only pauses in the fighting, because the underlying causes\\nhaven\\'t been solved. For our claim about borders, we can see that most\\ninternational borders in the world still hold up and are not challenged, but there are still a few dozen\\nterritorial disputes in the world, most of them in Africa and Asia. And some are getting hotter, like the border clash between\\nIndia and China over Aksai Chin and Arunachal Pradesh. China\\'s claim to Taiwan or Venezuela threatening to annex part of Guyana\\'s all rich province Essequibo. One thing that makes wars so deadly is that they\\'re often supported\\nby external powers. Many countries are providing support or arming up different sides or factions, like the competition between\\nSaudi Arabia and Iran for hegemony, with Iran being the main supporter\\nfor the Houthis, Hezbollah or Hamas. Or in the Ukrainian war,\\nwith the West supporting Ukraine while China, Iran\\nand North Korea support Russia. But it\\'s not just countries. External powers keeping conflicts alive can also be islamist groups like Isis or criminal networks. Or even local elites that benefit from their own country\\nbeing torn apart, and effectively prevent\\nconflicts from ending. [The end of the rules-based world?] There\\'s a lot of debate among experts about what factors make the world\\nmore or less peaceful, but there are no easy answers. One of the major reasons\\nthe world has seen less conflict was that, after the end of the Cold War, many countries expected\\na sort of rules-based world order. And for a time this worked, somewhat. But things have been changing\\nin the last few years. The world has become multipolar\\nwith new alliance is forming and the idea of a rules-based world\\nis being challenged. China\\'s manufacturing capacity is now as big as the US\\nand Europe\\'s combined. With its massive economic development,\\na new superpower has risen. It\\'s common knowledge\\nthat the US spends more on its military than any place in the world, but this may no longer reflect\\nthe true balance of power. China doesn\\'t report all\\nof its military spending like the US does and it gets a lot more done\\nwith each equivalent dollar spent. Recent estimates trying to account\\nfor these differences tell us China\\'s effective military budget is now a significant portion\\nof the United States\\'s budget. And with Russia breaking the taboo\\nof launching the first war of conquest by a major power in almost 80 years, Europe has begun the process of rearming. It is slow because, well, Europe is slow, but it is happening. We\\'re in the transition\\nto a multipolar world again with different nations and alliances claiming spheres of power\\nthey want to dominate. In this climate, tensions and conflicts\\nbetween states have been rising, even if most of them\\nhave not turned into wars yet. So, is war over? The clear answer is no, and the direction we\\'re headed in\\ndoesn\\'t seem great. But with all the gloom, it\\'s also true that we are still\\nin a peaceful period of world history and the deaths by war\\nare still at historic lows. The world is at a crossroads. We\\'ll do another update video in 2034. Let\\'s all hope we\\'ll have\\nbetter news for you then.

In a nutshell, the app and website\\ngather the world\\'s news in one place so you can compare coverage,\\nsee the bigger picture and make informed decision. Take the reporting on Russia\\'s and North\\nKorea\\'s recent defense treaty. There are hundreds\\nof headlines on this globally, including from many sources on the ground\\nlike Korea and Russia. Some report it as a defense deal, others call it an alliance\\nor strategic partnership, which creates very different images. The interesting insight is how most\\nof the sources are government-affiliated, which presumably affects\\ntheir choice of framing. Reading the news this way lets you compare\\ndifferent perspectives in one place, see how narratives and possibly\\npublic opinion could change.

pure energy and with a shell made of the weirdest material that's possible in nature what are they what do they look like and are they just a theoretical fever dream or will they change our understanding of the universe forever the birth of the most extreme objects in the Universe very massive stars die in the most dramatic way possible a supernova we've explained this process in detail before but in a nutshell in less than a second their cords collapse crushed under their extreme Gravity the star's shell rushes in bounces against the collapsing core and explodes shining brighter than whole galaxies depending on how massive the star was there are two possible outcomes either the core compresses into a superdense neutron star or it kind of breaks reality and collapses into a singularity an infinitely dense point with no size or Dimensions at all a place where the laws of the universe stop making sense and time and space are reversed a black hole grav stars are a third even weirder option instead of collapsing into an infinitely dense point the core is kind of ground down like a rock pulverized to dust by a cosmic hydraulic press atoms and particles are crushed so hard that they transform into Pure Energy a sort of mini Universe if you want and just like our universe this bubble violently wants to expand and grow in a fraction of a second the bubble smashes into the collapsing star around it the Unspeakable mass of the star collapsing under its own gravity meets the Titanic violence of the expanding energy bubble like an ancient god hammering on its anvil is trapped between an immovable object and an Unstoppable Force forging a new kind of material that we've never seen before but that we know is physically possible and then it suddenly stops a gravastar is born what does it look like Cosmic soap bubbles just like black holes a gravastar can have any Mass but a typical one would be about the size of the London metropolitan area and as massive as 10 Suns the shell of the gravastar is utterly dark and the coldest thing in the universe only a billionth of a degree above absolute zero if we look at it in deep infrared even the cosmic microwave background glows bright in comparison how can anything made of matter be that cold don't all atoms jiggle back and forth the thing is the Shell's not made out of atoms it's made from an entirely new unique and extreme matter that doesn't have a name yet and that's at the very limit of what's physically possible in nature actually the shell is so incredibly thin that atoms seem truly gigantic next to it and yet despite being ultra thin because it's been forged by two impossibly extreme forces the shell is incredibly tight so tight that if you wanted to stretch the whole Shell by just 1 meter you'd need the energy of an entire Supernova what about the inside well it only gets weirder the interior of a gravastar is perfectly simple because it's sort of empty completely empty a perfect vacuum without a single atom particle or wave but despite being as empty as it gets this vacuum is boiling with the most primitive and fundamental kind of energy in the universe we need a detour to explain how any of this makes sense the fundamental nothingness at the core of it all the inside of a gravastar breaks our brains a bit because it it's a sort of superc condensed nothingness what does this even mean we'll have to simplify and use metaphors to make sense of what scientists measure and calculate according to our current understanding of physics particles like quarks electrons photons and so on are not really solid objects but sort of waves in an ocean in our human world you can't have waves without water and in the smallest world you also can't have particle waves without some kind of underlying omnipresent Cosmic fluid this fluid is the vacuum what we perceive as nothingness it's the fundamental ocean at the bottom of reality the waves of this vacuum otion are the particles that make up you and everything else but even when there are no waves or particles traveling through it the fluid is still there and like any fluid we know it has inherent energy vacuum fluid is everywhere in the universe the room you're in is 99.98% vacuum between the air particles bouncing around between the trillions of particles making up your cells there's vacuum but it's different inide of gravar when our star collapsed and condensed so violently it was as if the universe took a cosmic pump and compressed as much vacuum fluid as physics allows into a kind of superdense nothingness as said before even without any waves the nothingness vacuum ocean of the universe has energy but the superdense vacuum inside a gravastar has almost a billion trillion trillion trillion times more energy per cubic cm than the vacuum outside the star this is an unbelievable amount of energy and mass in a tiny space just like you may have guessed it black holes this intensely compressed vacuum ocean can't be compressed any further it's at the absolute physical limit of anything that can be squeezed together without breaking physics like black holes do the ocean would love to stop being so so tight it wants to stretch out and flow back into the ocean that surrounds the star but it's trapped in the safest prison possible the shell which itself is right at the edge of the physical limit of any material possible an eternal stalemate between two limits of the universe let's leave this world of metaphors and get back to our world that feels more real in our world gravastar are perfectly black Eternal objects with borderline insane amounts of mass because they're so cold dark and massive from the outside gra stars look and behave exactly like black holes both massively curve space around them and create all the fun effects we love black holes for from trapping mass and light in accretion discs or slowing down time as you get closer for details we've made one or two videos on black holes before if you fell into a gravastar you'd be extremely dead before you even H the surface ripped apart and ground down by the gravitational forces and once your SC Ed remains touch the shell the atoms you were once made of would probably break down and dissolve completely only to be converted into the vacuum energy of the Interior making the gravastar an infinitesimal bit bigger and an infinite decimal bit more massive okay this was fun and all but what exactly is the point isn't this just another video of wild scientific speculation just for the sake of it the point black holes were suggested more than a century ago as an abstract solution to equations of gravity for more than 50 years they were considered mathematically valid but too absurd to be real few believed they actually existed but scientists kept working on paper and looking at weird things and then we saw Stars being thrown around by invisible Titans we saw light stretching around invisible gaps in the sky and as our technology and theories improved we even sort of took a picture of them we have evidence for them and they fit on theories and nowadays it's kind of common sense to accept them as real black holes are extremely elegant and fascinating but they also created a lot of questions that have traumatized physicists for decades singularities literally break our best understanding of physics they seem to delete information which shouldn't be possible grav stars are a relatively new idea without any of those problems they don't need singularities that break physics or delete information they solve the puzzles of black holes but they too create new problems like weird exotic matter for their incredibly cold and tight shell super DSE nothing to make a super massive empty core but just like black holes they do work on paper and fit what we see in the sky so are they real and will we ever know actually there is a way to find out black holes have an event horizon while gravastar have a physical shell made of matter which means that they behave very differently When They smash into each other the Collision of two objects as massive as they are creates huge amounts of gravitational waves ripples in SpaceTime that travel at the speed of light you can think of them as the music of cosmic cataclysms the Collision of two black holes should sound like a bass drum a deep thumb that stops quickly but two gravastar colliding should sound like a Gong leaving subtle Echoes behind scien artists are listening for these Echoes In The Music of the cosmos unfortunately black holes and gravastar are surrounded by such strong gravity that it swamps most of the music it's like trying to tell two instruments apart through a thick wall of concrete you need very sharp technology for that while we've made incredible progress in the last few years we're not quite there yet so this is where we'll end this story gravastar have the potential to answer some of the biggest problems in physics or they're just another idea for our discard pile but this is why we do science to learn that everything is different to the way we thought it is until the day we truly

finally\\xa0\\na less bad alternative to smoking. It\\xa0\\xa0 delivers one of the most popular\\xa0\\ndrugs in the world: Nicotine. It may improve your attention, concentration,\\xa0\\xa0 memory, reaction time and endurance. It\\xa0\\ncan reduce anxiety and stress and help\\xa0\\xa0 you relax and enhance your mood. Nicotine also\\xa0\\nsuppresses hunger, making it easier to maintain\\xa0\\xa0 or lose weight. And it is simply fun to put\\xa0\\na thing in your mouth and get a little kick. Compared to other stimulants,\\xa0\\nnicotine's effect doesn't come\\xa0\\xa0 at the same high price for our bodies. It\\xa0\\nis also crystal clear that vaping is way,\\xa0\\xa0 way less harmful than smoking. Smoking delivers,\\xa0\\xa0 well, hot smoke and extremely toxic particles\\xa0\\ndirectly into your lungs, causing serious damage\\xa0\\xa0 all over your body right away. But we will\\xa0\\npurely focus on nicotine vapes in this video. Ok sure, nicotine is one of\\xa0the \\nmost addictive substances\\xa0\\xa0we know. But vaping on its own seems kinda\\xa0\\nok. So is it really that bad if you do it? Well, we should find out quickly. While in the\\xa0\\nWest smoking is slowly falling out of fashion,\\xa0\\xa0 especially among teens vaping has become a\\xa0\\ngrowing epidemic. In 2023, in the UK 20% of\\xa0\\xa0 children have tried vaping at least once. In\\xa0\\nthe US 8% of all students are currently vaping\\xa0\\xa0 regularly. One in four of them do it daily,\\xa0\\nand almost all of them use vapes with flavours. So how does vaping work and\\xa0\\nwhat does it do to your body? How does Vaping work? A vape is basically a small tank of liquid,\\xa0\\nheated up by a metallic coil, that vaporises it. The major ingredient in most vape\\xa0\\njuice is propylene glycol and glycerol,\\xa0\\xa0 the main chemicals in smoke machines, which\\xa0\\nare also used in countless chemical processes.\\xa0\\xa0 From food like candy and baking mixes, to\\xa0\\ncosmetics, paints or plastics. Then there\\xa0\\xa0 are the nicotine salts containing the magic\\xa0\\nand dozens of different flavour molecules. When you pull on a vape, the metal coil heats up\\xa0\\nand turns the liquid into the vapor you inhale.\\xa0\\xa0 Vapor sounds kind of nice, harmless and pleasant.\\xa0\\nBut vapes don’t produce actual vapor, but a heated\\xa0\\xa0 mist of aerosol. A warm sticky substance\\xa0\\nmade out of large molecules and microscopic\\xa0\\xa0 particles mixed with air. The best thing to\\xa0\\ncompare it to is inhaling warm body spray. When you take a hit, billions of aerosol\\xa0\\nparticles cover your mouth and tongue\\xa0\\xa0 making you taste pleasant stuff, and enter\\xa0\\ninto your lungs. They reach your alveoli,\\xa0\\xa0 little air sacs where the breathing\\xa0\\nhappens. Here the nicotine passes\\xa0\\xa0 into your bloodstream and is transported into\\xa0\\nyour brain to cause all the pleasant effects. And here the complications begin. What is actually in your vape? The scary answer is that we don’t really know. Studies found that vape liquids can be\\xa0\\nthousands of very different mixes of\\xa0\\xa0 many dozens of substances. The majority were\\xa0\\nnot even mentioned on the label. This seems\\xa0\\xa0 almost unbelievable, but the vaping industry\\xa0\\nis much less regulated than you’d think. We know that many official substances\\xa0\\nin vapes are technically safe. Kinda.\\xa0\\xa0 They’re used in cosmetics, medicine or\\xa0\\nfood and have been extensively tested.\\xa0\\xa0 Most are safe to eat or put on your skin. But\\xa0\\nthat is not the same as breathing them in. Cinnamaldehyde, found in cinnamon oil, kills\\xa0\\ncells and causes genetic damage when inhaled.\\xa0\\xa0 Benzaldehyde found in almonds or apples has a\\xa0\\nfruity taste and is common in cherry, berry,\\xa0\\xa0 chocolate or mint flavoured vapes. As a\\xa0\\ngas, it irritates the respiratory tract. What is worse is that we don’t know what many\\xa0\\nsubstances in vape juice do if heated up.\\xa0\\xa0 The longer you inhale and the hotter the coil\\xa0\\ngets, the more chemicals in the juice change.\\xa0\\xa0 Molecules merge or break down, creating\\xa0\\nnew compounds with unknown consequences. When propylene glycol and\\xa0\\nglycerol are heated too much,\\xa0\\xa0 they decompose and turn into harmful\\xa0\\nmolecules. This can happen when the\\xa0\\xa0 liquid runs out or the coil gets too hot. You\\xa0\\nwill probably notice this because your vape\\xa0\\xa0 will taste weird or burned – if this\\xa0\\nhappens you should stop right away. And it gets worse. When the metal coil is\\xa0\\nheated up, it releases metal particles.\\xa0\\xa0 Studies found aluminium, boron, calcium,\\xa0\\niron, copper, magnesium, zinc, lead, chromium,\\xa0\\xa0 nickel, and manganese in the vapor – all of\\xa0\\nwhich vary from really bad news to straight\\xa0\\xa0 up toxic and can cause lung irritation,\\xa0\\nchronic bronchitis and shortness of\\xa0\\xa0 breath in the short term. Nickel can\\xa0\\nalso cause cancer when breathed in. All of these mystery substances\\xa0\\nalso interact with each other\\xa0\\xa0 in new and exciting ways. In\\xa0\\nbad ways? We don’t know yet. What do we know about the\\xa0\\nhealth effects of vaping? What Does Vaping DO in Your Body? The elephant in the room is that we don’t know\\xa0\\nexactly how bad vaping is, since it has only\\xa0\\xa0 been around for about ten years. Also, most\\xa0\\nstudies on health effects in humans focused\\xa0\\xa0 on smokers who switched to vapes. We do know for\\xa0\\nsure that smoking is orders of magnitudes more\\xa0\\xa0 harmful. Switching to vaping will reduce your\\xa0\\nrisks of disease massively. If you smoke,\\xa0\\xa0 please switch to vaping. But these\\xa0\\nstudies also muddy the water a bit. What if you never smoked and started to vape? In\\xa0\\nthe short term, a significant portion of vapers\\xa0\\xa0 develop poor breathing symptoms: coughing,\\xa0\\nextra mucus production, shortness of breath,\\xa0\\xa0 wheezing, throat and chest pain. But the\\xa0\\ntruth is we simply don’t know what will\\xa0\\xa0 happen in the long term. The first larger\\xa0\\nscale study on vaping with non-smokers\\xa0\\xa0 only started in 2024 – it will take years\\xa0\\nbefore we can say anything with confidence. We can make careful assumptions\\xa0\\nbut take them with a grain of salt. Your lungs are made from very sensitive tissue\\xa0\\nand were never meant to deal with trillions of\\xa0\\xa0 aerosols, chemicals and metals. What goes into\\xa0\\nyour lungs generally stays in them forever,\\xa0\\xa0 which is why smokers’ lungs are dark and dirty. It seems that vaping activates the immune\\xa0\\nsystem, which tries to clean up the aerosols.\\xa0\\xa0 This causes inflammation and fluid seeps\\xa0\\ninto the lungs, while the cells guarding\\xa0\\xa0 their entry produce extra mucus you have\\xa0\\nto cough out. Some of them may even die. Vaping also may cause stress all over your body:\\xa0\\xa0 it may increase your heart rate and blood\\xa0\\npressure, lower blood oxygen or stiffen\\xa0\\xa0 and clog up your blood vessels. It may create\\xa0\\noxidative stress, which has all sorts of bad\\xa0\\xa0 effects on your organs and may potentially\\xa0\\ncause many different diseases over time. Does this increase your risk of strokes, heart\\xa0\\ndiseases, lung diseases or cause cancer? Again,\\xa0\\xa0 we don’t know. Maybe it causes damage, but\\xa0\\nsomething else will kill you before vaping\\xa0\\xa0 does. Maybe it will make you sick.\\xa0\\nBut all we have right now is: Maybe. We are conducting one of the largest\\xa0\\nmedical experiments in history.\\xa0\\xa0 If you are vaping you’re a test subject. Too Much of the Wonder Drug What is new about vaping is the sheer\\xa0\\namount of nicotine it delivers into\\xa0\\xa0 your system. For most people it is kind of\\xa0\\nhard to smoke 20+ cigarettes a day because\\xa0\\xa0 smoking is pretty harsh. As vaping is\\xa0\\nless aggressive and doesn’t smell bad,\\xa0\\xa0 you can do it inside and constantly, for hours.\\xa0\\nIt is easy to go through an entire vape a day. They shower\\xa0your brain in \\nextremely high nicotine doses,\\xa0\\xa0 which makes them extremely addictive. For teens this may be very bad. During your\\xa0\\nteenage years your brain is developing and\\xa0\\xa0 your nicotine receptors are especially\\xa0\\nactive. They are directly linked with\\xa0\\xa0 your reward system and thus, how you\\xa0\\nfeel about yourself and your life.\\xa0\\xa0 Nicotine may change brain development by\\xa0\\noverstimulating the nicotine receptors. Again, the science is pretty\\xa0\\nannoying here with loads of caveats. Nicotine in teens has been\\xa0\\nlinked to cognitive deficits,\\xa0\\xa0 hyperactivity, reduced impulse control,\\xa0\\ndeficits in attention and cognition,\\xa0\\xa0 and mood disorders. But there is a chicken\\xa0\\nand egg problem – did nicotine cause this\\xa0\\xa0 or are people with a tendency for emotional\\xa0\\ndysregulation just more likely to use it? There have been studies that suggest nicotine\\xa0\\nis a gateway drug making it more likely to\\xa0\\xa0 develop other addictions. But this has been\\xa0\\nlargely rejected. Instead it seems people who\\xa0\\xa0 are generally more likely to take risks, tend\\xa0\\nto do more risky things. They are more likely\\xa0\\xa0 to get addicted to smoking, alcohol or cannabis,\\xa0\\nhard drugs or gambling. This doesn’t make vaping\\xa0\\xa0 any less addictive, it just means that it is\\xa0\\nprobably not the cause of other addictions. Where the science is pretty solid, is\\xa0\\nthat most people have a bad time when\\xa0\\xa0 quitting nicotine. Nicotine is one of\\xa0\\nthe most addictive substances we know\\xa0\\xa0 and comes with a wide range of really\\xa0\\nunpleasant physical withdrawal symptoms. You can be on edge and experience\\xa0\\nintense craving for nicotine,\\xa0\\xa0 unpleasant mood swings and anxiety.\\xa0\\nYou can have difficulty sleeping,\\xa0\\xa0 fatigue and headaches and trouble concentrating.\\xa0\\nIt can be harder to experience joy and to deal\\xa0\\xa0 with stress. And it can make depression\\xa0\\nworse. Without nicotine your suppressed\\xa0\\xa0 appetite comes back and since some people\\xa0\\ncompensate by eating more, they put on weight. All of this makes quitting nicotine extremely\\xa0\\nhard. On top comes psychological addiction,\\xa0\\xa0 that can be intense, since vaping\\xa0\\nis extremely habit forming. The good news is that these symptoms are\\xa0\\nentirely reversible. It takes about 72\\xa0\\xa0 hours for the nicotine to leave your body\\xa0\\nand the worst withdrawal symptoms fade\\xa0\\xa0 out or stop entirely in a few weeks.  Conclusion The problem with vaping is that it is\\xa0\\ntoo good. It tastes great, it’s pleasant\\xa0\\xa0 and stimulating. But it also supercharges\\xa0\\nnicotine and makes it even more addictive. Every smoker who switches from cigarettes\\xa0\\nto vapes is a win for global health. But\\xa0\\xa0 this is where the benefits end. Vaping has\\xa0\\nalready hooked a significant portion of\\xa0\\xa0 the younger generations to nicotine\\xa0\\nand that is really bad news. It is kind of unfair to expect young people\\xa0\\nto resist vaping by providing information\\xa0\\xa0 about how bad it is or might be. Scaring people\\xa0\\nstraight is a bad strategy. If you are addicted\\xa0\\xa0 to nicotine, you use it to fight stress. And if\\xa0\\nyou stress someone out by telling them that the\\xa0\\xa0 thing they use to fight stress is bad, they do the\\xa0\\nthing, to fight the stress you are causing them. Basically, humans developed a new way to make one\\xa0\\nof the most addictive substances, that was on the\\xa0\\xa0 decline, attractive to millions of teens by making\\xa0\\nit taste like bubblegum. Vaping is still very\\xa0\\xa0 new – and we still have a chance to curb this new\\xa0\\nglobal addiction before it gets out of control. Making decisions that affect your health\\xa0\\nis hard enough, but it’s impossible to base\\xa0\\xa0 them on rational ground if you don’t\\xa0\\nhave reliable information available. Algorithms are constantly working behind the\\xa0\\nscenes to decide which information to show you,\\xa0\\xa0 and alarmist headlines get amplified over\\xa0\\nstraightforward reporting. But Ground News,\\xa0\\xa0 the sponsor of this video, can give you back\\xa0\\na feeling of independence. We have a personal\\xa0\\xa0 connection to them: our founder Philipp was\\xa0\\nimmensely bored while getting chemotherapy\\xa0\\xa0 a few years back and decided to read all\\xa0\\nGerman newspapers, even the ones he hated,\\xa0\\xa0 front to back every day. He was shocked\\xa0\\nto see the bias he suspected confirmed,\\xa0\\xa0 and all the stories each side decided not to\\xa0\\nreport on. This experiment lead him to Ground News. In a nutshell, the app and website gather\\xa0\\nthe worlds news in one place so you\\xa0\\xa0 can compare coverage, see the bigger\\xa0\\npicture and make informed decisions. For example, recently a study was released\\xa0\\nclaiming that in England, “1 million who\\xa0\\xa0 never smoked started vaping.” Ground News gives\\xa0\\nme perspective: this was barely reported by 20\\xa0\\xa0 sources, a small number in comparison to\\xa0\\nhundreds of headlines on the FDA’s first\\xa0\\xa0 authorization of vaping products three years ago,\\xa0\\nback when some even cited benefits for smokers. This way you can compare different perspectives in\\xa0\\none place, see how the story and coverage change\\xa0\\xa0 and also reference the original story study to\\xa0\\nmake sure no nuance is lost. You also get a sense\\xa0\\xa0 of the bigger picture and how much weight a story\\xa0\\nreally carries to tell apart reason from racket. Go to ground.news/nutshell to give it\\xa0\\na try.

And for very good reasons! Compared to\\xa0\\nlegal drugs like alcohol – which will\\xa0\\xa0 cause one in twenty deaths just this\\xa0\\nyear, cannabis is pretty mild. So to\\xa0\\xa0 justify harsh prosecution and punishment, its\\xa0\\nnegative effects have been wildly overstated. Naturally there was a lot of pushback and\\xa0\\nhere something went wrong. If you’ve followed\\xa0\\xa0 the discourse over the last few years, you might\\xa0\\nhave got the impression that weed has almost only\\xa0\\xa0 upsides and few, if any, negative side effects.\\xa0\\nWe ourselves contributed to that narrative. What made this worse is that criminalization made\\xa0\\nit very hard for scientists to study cannabis,\\xa0\\xa0 especially its long term effects.\\xa0\\nThey faced bureaucratic and legal\\xa0\\xa0 hurdles and studies often had\\xa0\\nto rely on small sample sizes. In the last few years this\\xa0\\nfinally started to change,\\xa0\\xa0 so it is time to bring new evidence to the\\xa0\\ndiscussion. And well, it's not pretty. While\\xa0\\xa0 weed is still much less harmful than alcohol,\\xa0\\nit does have a dark side. It is more addictive\\xa0\\xa0 than we thought and can have significant\\xa0\\nnegative effects if you use it long term. It seems that…ehm, what are you doing? Before you tell us how dumb we are, please\\xa0\\nwatch the video. To be crystal clear,\\xa0\\xa0 we think prohibition doesn’t work and\\xa0\\nCannabis should be legal. But this also\\xa0\\xa0 means that we need to treat it as what it is:\\xa0\\nA drug. With unique upsides and downsides. So let’s take an honest look at some\\xa0\\nof the latest research together. Weed is getting stronger and stronger Cannabis’s magic juice is Tetrahydrocannabinol,\\xa0\\xa0 THC. It docks on your cannabinoid receptors,\\xa0\\nwhich affects various brain functions. THC\\xa0\\xa0 activates some regions and calms down others,\\xa0\\ncreating a fun cocktail of sensations. The more THC, the more intense the high.\\xa0\\nAnd people seem to be into higher highs,\\xa0\\xa0 or at least this is what the market is providing.\\xa0\\nIn the US, Canada and in Europe the concentration\\xa0\\xa0 of THC in legal and illegal Cannabis products has\\xa0\\nmore than doubled in the last few decades. While\\xa0\\xa0 ever more potent strains are bred, products like\\xa0\\nedibles or concentrates with more than 60% THC\\xa0\\xa0 have become increasingly common. While the share\\xa0\\nof products with less than 15% THC has declined. Unfortunately just about every problem weed\\xa0\\ncreates gets worse at higher THC doses. At the same time more and more people use weed.\\xa0\\nIn the US more people consumed cannabis daily\\xa0\\xa0 than alcohol for the first time in 2022. In\\xa0\\nCanada 26% of people 16 and older use it,\\xa0\\xa0 up from 22% in 2018. It is not possible to say\\xa0\\nif legalization is the reason for this though,\\xa0\\xa0 since studies are pretty inconsistent and vary\\xa0\\nmassively between different users. In some,\\xa0\\xa0 consumption went up, in others it stayed\\xa0\\nstable – and the trend to use more weed\\xa0\\xa0 began in the early 90s and sped up in\\xa0\\nthe 2000s, way earlier than legalization. So today more people consume more weed\\xa0\\nthan ever before in the last century\\xa0\\xa0 and it is the strongest it’s ever been.\\xa0\\nWhat are we seeing as a result of this?\\xa0\\xa0 Let’s start with something that used to\\xa0\\nget you laughed out of the room: Addiction. Weed Addiction And Withdrawal Symptoms A big narrative about weed\\xa0\\nis that it is not addictive,\\xa0\\xa0 or at least not that big of a deal.\\xa0\\nAnd for most people this is true. Studies clearly show that the majority\\xa0\\nhandle it well – For 8 out of 10 using weed,\\xa0\\xa0 it is just a casual high\\xa0\\nand not problematic at all. About 2 in 10 users develop a cannabis use\\xa0\\ndisorder, or CUD. CUD has 11 different symptoms,\\xa0\\xa0 from the inability to stop when you’ve\\xa0\\nhad enough, to using it when you know it\\xa0\\xa0 will have negative consequences, to tolerance and\\xa0\\nwithdrawal. They can all basically be reduced to:\\xa0\\xa0 You are doing it too often, even if it's bad\\xa0\\nfor you and it is less fun than it could be. There are three major risk factors here: The\\xa0\\namount of THC, how often you consume and your age\\xa0\\xa0 when you start using cannabis. The more THC, the\\xa0\\nmore often and the younger you are when you start,\\xa0\\xa0 the higher your risk. If you smoke too much\\xa0\\nweed, too often, it will have negative impacts\\xa0\\xa0 on your life. So if this is you, toning\\xa0\\nit down a bit will make a big difference. 1 in 10 users develops a serious addiction.\\xa0\\nThey usually consume daily and their life\\xa0\\xa0 is significantly impaired or held\\xa0\\nback – because they spend a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 their time either using or recovering\\xa0\\nfrom cannabis use. Since their brain is\\xa0\\xa0 building a tolerance they need increasingly\\xa0\\nhigh doses or stronger weed, often both. Studies found a variety of negative effects: Heavy\\xa0\\nusers can experience bad moods, feel irritable,\\xa0\\xa0 restless, paranoid, anxious and even\\xa0\\ndepressive. In a sad twist of irony,\\xa0\\xa0 for many addicts it feels like they need weed\\xa0\\nto fight these symptoms – maybe it did actually\\xa0\\xa0 help at first – while in reality, it makes\\xa0\\nthose symptoms stronger and more persistent. Studies also found that loneliness and frequent\\xa0\\ncannabis use go hand in hand. If you feel lonely\\xa0\\xa0 you are more likely to use weed and if you use\\xa0\\nweed you may experience more loneliness. It is\\xa0\\xa0 not always easy to say which came first,\\xa0\\nbut they seem to reinforce each other. So, on the one hand, cannabis makes loneliness\\xa0\\nfeel much less bad. On the other hand,\\xa0\\xa0 it can also make you feel more socially awkward\\xa0\\nthan you actually are and withdraw from friends.\\xa0\\xa0 This can lead to a downward spiral that ends\\xa0\\nin self isolation and chronic loneliness. Another thing many people who consume a lot\\xa0\\nexperience is a mental numbness that makes\\xa0\\xa0 boredom feel ok because it impacts the\\xa0\\nreward system of your brain. Not great,\\xa0\\xa0 but good enough. You can spend your days\\xa0\\nkilling time, bingeing mildly interesting\\xa0\\xa0 stuff. Being numb rather than having fun. Boredom\\xa0\\nis a signal to your mind to get creative or learn\\xa0\\xa0 something new, but this is suppressed. This\\xa0\\nalso makes quitting so much harder, because\\xa0\\xa0 your daily routines suddenly seem boring and\\xa0\\nunexciting, making it very tempting to go back. If you find yourself using constantly, this\\xa0\\ncan also stunt your development as a person.\\xa0\\xa0 The numbness dulls bad feelings, making it easy\\xa0\\nnot to deal with them. But in life you can only\\xa0\\xa0 get over bad feelings if you actually feel\\xa0\\nthem and you have to process them to grow. Lastly, let us talk about physical withdrawal\\xa0\\nsymptoms – the more you consume the worse they\\xa0\\xa0 will be for you, especially if you use\\xa0\\ndaily. Withdrawal can cause headaches,\\xa0\\xa0 sweating or chills, decreased appetite, in severe\\xa0\\ncases even fever, nausea and abdominal pain. You\\xa0\\xa0 might have trouble falling asleep and if you do,\\xa0\\nyou might have disturbing and vivid dreams. The\\xa0\\xa0 withdrawal can put you in a depressive mood\\xa0\\nwhere life feels daft and pointless. You can\\xa0\\xa0 feel restless, angry, anxious or nervous.\\xa0\\nYou may feel unable to do anything at all. After a few days these symptoms will begin to\\xa0\\nsubside and after a few weeks they will be gone\\xa0\\xa0 entirely – the exact time depends on how much\\xa0\\nand how long you have been consuming cannabis. Now let’s get to the worst part. Weed May Damage Your Brain This section was not fun to research because\\xa0\\nthere is fierce debate among researchers how\\xa0\\xa0 bad weed is for your brain, and whether\\xa0\\nit has irreversible long term consequences\\xa0\\xa0 or not. There is no consensus yet and\\xa0\\nit's hard to say anything definitive. Having said that, THC directly interferes\\xa0\\nwith critical brain chemistry. There is some\\xa0\\xa0 evidence that it may alter\\xa0\\nits structure. If it does,\\xa0\\xa0 this may go away again if you quit after\\xa0\\na few years. Or not. We don’t know yet. The consequences vary a lot between individuals\\xa0\\nbut especially for heavy users they have a\\xa0\\xa0 variety of potentially unfunny downsides:\\xa0\\nThe most common one is that your memory gets\\xa0\\xa0 significantly worse. Sustained heavy use may\\xa0\\nreduce your ability to learn, your reasoning,\\xa0\\xa0 perception, attention span, decision making,\\xa0\\nlanguage abilities and impulse control. Most\\xa0\\xa0 negative effects seem to go away or at\\xa0\\nleast weaken over time after you quit,\\xa0\\xa0 but again we simply don’t know\\xa0\\nenough and need more research. Where the evidence is much clearer\\xa0\\nis that consuming a lot of weed is\\xa0\\xa0 really bad for teenagers on multiple\\xa0\\nlevels. If you start using heavily,\\xa0\\xa0 early, you have many more years to\\xa0\\nbuild up potentially negative side\\xa0\\xa0 effects. Teens who use a lot are much\\xa0\\nmore likely to become addicted to weed. This may just be correlation and\\xa0\\nweed may not be the underlying cause,\\xa0\\xa0 but heavy weed users are more likely to\\xa0\\nperform poorly in school and less likely\\xa0\\xa0 to finish their education. They are on average\\xa0\\nless satisfied with their life and what they\\xa0\\xa0 achieved. This may simply be because if\\xa0\\nyour memory and motivation are stunted,\\xa0\\xa0 you have fewer interesting experiences\\xa0\\nand forget the ones you do have. And there is strong evidence that teens users\\xa0\\nare way more likely to develop mental health\\xa0\\xa0 issues like psychosis, schizophrenia, depression\\xa0\\nor anxiety later in life. Once again, the younger\\xa0\\xa0 you start, the higher the risk – and it also\\xa0\\nseems to rise massively with high THC doses,\\xa0\\xa0 making highly potent cannabis products even more\\xa0\\ndangerous for teens. Ok let’s wrap this up. We’ve\\xa0\\xa0 only focused on the negative sides in this video,\\xa0\\nthat was the whole point. As we said before,\\xa0\\xa0 for most people weed in moderation is totally\\xa0\\nfine and definitely way less harmful than alcohol.\\xa0\\xa0 You do you, we are not your parents. The upside\\xa0\\nof moderation is also that when you do it,\\xa0\\xa0 your experience will be more intense and special. But for teens, weed, especially using it\\xa0\\nregularly or a lot of it, is a bad idea,\\xa0\\xa0 with potentially life changing consequences.\\xa0\\nWe know that criminalization did nothing to\\xa0\\xa0 make this better. We now have a new chance under\\xa0\\nlegalization. It begins with being open and honest\\xa0\\xa0 about the state of science and acknowledging that\\xa0\\nweed is one drug among many others. Certainly not\\xa0\\xa0 the worst one by a long shot. But also problematic\\xa0\\nfor at least 1 to 3 out of ten people using it. If you really have to try cannabis,\\xa0\\nthere is a time and place – and that\\xa0\\xa0 is in your twenties. If you are\\xa0\\nyounger, the science is clear:\\xa0\\xa0 Don’t do it. At least not yet. You’ll\\xa0\\nhave plenty of time to experiment later.

The goal:\\xa0\\na single nuclear bomb so powerful it would\\xa0\\xa0 destroy all of human civilization. Conceived in\\xa0\\ncold logic from the mind of a genius scientist. Sundial had the energy equivalent of\\xa0\\n10 billion tons of TNT. A pyramid of\\xa0\\xa0 explosives thirteen times taller than the\\xa0\\nactual Great Pyramid. Three thousand more\\xa0\\xa0 than all the bombs dropped during World\\xa0\\nWar II. If you dropped the bomb that\\xa0\\xa0 destroyed Hiroshima every minute, it would\\ntake you over 15 months to match Sundial. How was it even possible for us to\\xa0\\nachieve this insane level of madness? Everything is Different Forever Let’s set the stage. If you\\xa0\\nwere 40 in 1945 that means\\xa0\\xa0 you were you had been born in 1905 – back\\xa0\\nthen monarchs ruled over much of the world,\\xa0\\xa0 only 3% of homes in the US had electricity, cities\\xa0\\nwere dominated by horses, the first experimental\\xa0\\xa0 planes had just flown. Less than a hundred\\xa0\\nthousand soldiers died in war each year. Imagine growing up in this world and\\xa0\\nseeing change almost too fast to keep\\xa0\\xa0 up with. By 1945, 24 million soldiers\\xa0\\nand 50 million civilians had died in\\xa0\\xa0 two world wars. And suddenly\\xa0\\nthere were TVs, microwaves,\\xa0\\xa0 jet planes and … nuclear bombs. They kind of\\xa0\\nbroke the brains of the people alive back then. Overnight, nowhere from the edge of space to\\xa0\\nthe bottom of the ocean was safe. It's hard\\xa0for us today to understand the level\\xa0\\nof terror this instilled in people. The implications were wild. Without\\xa0\\nnuclear weapons it seemed you would\\xa0\\xa0 stand no chance in future conflicts.\\xa0\\nNations without that power would get\\xa0\\xa0 trampled by those that did have it,\\xa0\\nno matter how big their armies were. There was one brief moment where it could all\\xa0\\nhave been stopped: In 1946 the US proposed the\\xa0\\xa0 Baruch Plan and promised to get rid of their\\xa0\\natom bombs, share nuclear technology with the\\xa0\\xa0 world and set up an international authority\\xa0\\nto make sure no-one ever builtds such weapons\\xa0\\xa0 again. But the military advantage of\\xa0\\nnuclear bombs was too great to let go. Just three years later the Soviet\\xa0\\nUnion detonated their first atom\\xa0\\xa0 bomb. This caught everyone by complete\\xa0\\nsurprise. The Soviets were not decades\\xa0\\xa0 behind American technology\\xa0\\nbut had just pulled even. Shock turned into fear. And fear makes people\\xa0\\ndo crazy things.The whole concept of what war\\xa0\\xa0 was and how it would be won was overturned\\xa0\\nin a hot second. In a world where your enemy\\xa0\\xa0 could fly over your soldiers and vaporise your\\xa0\\ncities, the only answer seemed to be a nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 arsenal that could strike faster and harder.\\xa0\\nThe nuclear arms race began. In 1946 there\\xa0\\xa0 were just 9 nuclear bombs in the world. In 1950\\xa0\\nthe number was 300. In 1960 it would be 20,000. In a way the nuclear arms race was pretty daft.\\xa0\\nOne superpower would develop a powerful new bomb\\xa0\\xa0 and detonate it. And then the other side would\\xa0\\nbuild something more powerful and blow it up,\\xa0\\xa0 and this would continue endlessly. A dirty\\xa0\\nand wasteful game of creating more and more\\xa0\\xa0 horror that seemed totally reasonable at\\xa0\\nthe time. Superpowers spent trillions to\\xa0\\xa0 have thousands of the most intelligent people\\xa0\\nshow off how hard they could destroy humanity.\\xa0\\xa0 Fear had to be met with much greater horrors,\\xa0\\nand one man knew how to make nightmares real. But What if We Destroy Humanity Even HARDER? Edward Teller was a brilliant Hungarian\\xa0\\ntheoretical physicist. He was among the\\xa0\\xa0 first people to realize that the fission chain\\xa0\\nreaction in uranium could make a bomb. And he\\xa0\\xa0 helped to build it. But for Teller,\\xa0\\nthe bombs were not powerful enough.\\xa0\\xa0 He was ready to pay any price for security.\\xa0\\nAnd to be more secure, to be less afraid,\\xa0\\xa0 he urged that larger bombs were the\\xa0\\nanswer. Even in the 1950s this was a\\xa0\\xa0 pretty hot take and many scientists were\\xa0\\nappalled by his ideas. He didn’t care one\\xa0\\xa0 bit and incessantly lobbied scared politicians\\xa0\\nto green light more devastating nuclear weapons. And lucky for him, his timing was just right.\\xa0\\nTerrified by the rapid nuclear progress of the\\xa0\\xa0 Soviet Union, he got a blank cheque from the\\xa0\\nmilitary to bring his most destructive fantasy\\xa0\\xa0 to life. It took him only a few years to\\xa0\\nmake them a reality: The Hydrogen bomb. A hydrogen bomb is so powerful that it needs\\xa0\\na regular atom bomb just to trigger it. It is basically a nuke, the first stage, next\\xa0\\nto a capsule of fusion fuel, the second stage,\\xa0\\xa0 encased by dense materials like lead.\\xa0\\nWhen the atom bomb is detonated,\\xa0\\xa0 it releases stupendousungodly amounts of\\xa0\\nX-rays that get channelled onto the capsule.\\xa0\\xa0 The capsule’s surface explodes,\\xa0\\npushing inward and compressing\\xa0\\xa0 the fusion fuel so violently that for\\xa0\\na brief moment it simulates a star. When this bomb was first tested\\xa0\\nin 1952 it instantly erased a\\xa0\\xa0 pacific island from the map. Two years\\xa0\\nlater he tested an even bigger nuke,\\xa0\\xa0 1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb.\\xa0\\nThe world recoiled in horror. With weapons this\\xa0\\xa0 powerful war stopped being about winning and\\xa0\\ntotal human annihilation became very real. Teller celebrated. In just two years\\xa0\\nhe had enabled the creation of American\\xa0\\xa0 warheads a hundred times more powerful.\\xa0\\nHe had stolen the nuclear fire from the\\xa0\\xa0 gods and awoken cosmic horrors but he\\xa0\\ninsisted that it was still not enough. His dream was to have a bomb of almost unlimited\\xa0\\npower. And once again, his timing was pretty\\xa0\\xa0 great. When the Soviet Union detonated its own\\xa0\\nhydrogen bomb, it sparked a new wave of fear. This is where we get the \\ntop secret project\\xa0Sundial. The bomb to make\\xa0all\\nother bombs irrelevant. The Final Bomb Teller skipped right to the end. The end of the\\xa0\\nnuclear arms race. He wanted to build a world\\xa0\\xa0 destroyer. Something so breathtakingly\\xa0\\ndestructive, so incredibly scary,\\xa0\\xa0 that it made no sense to continue playing.\\xa0\\nAlmost everything about it is still classified,\\xa0\\xa0 but what we do know about it is terrifying. Work\\xa0\\non it actually began and tests were planned. Sundial wouldn’t be some warhead loaded up onto a\\xa0\\nbomber and dropped on a target. No. It would be a\\xa0\\xa0 backyard bomb. After all, if a bomb can\\ndestroy the world, why bother moving it at\\xa0\\xa0 all? No need to bring it close to your enemies,\\xa0\\nyou could as well just put it in your backyard. Maybe it would have actually been\\xa0\\nput in the center of the country,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe it would have been put on a\\xa0\\nremote island or stored on a ship,\\xa0\\xa0 we don’t know what the actual\\xa0\\nplans were. But this underlines how\\xa0\\xa0 insane this weapon was and that Teller knew\\xa0\\nexactly what he was proposing. In his mind,\\xa0\\xa0 the rationale was the ultimate deterrence – If you\\xa0\\nattack us or our allies we will destroy the world. On a technical level his concept was not\\xa0\\neven that complicated. It was probably some\\xa0\\xa0 kind of nuclear matryoshka doll. The\\xa0\\ntruly breathtaking thing is the idea\\xa0\\xa0 itself and that he actually attempted\\xa0\\nto make it real. From what we know,\\xa0\\xa0 Sundial would have weighed at least 2000 tons,\\xa0\\nas massive as a 250 meter long cargo train.\\xa0\\xa0 It would explode with the power of at least 10\\xa0\\nbillion tons of TNT. A number so big it doesn’t\\xa0\\xa0 mean anything anymore. So let’s make this a\\xa0\\nbit more graphic and explode it in Nevada. One wild thing about it is that humanity\\xa0\\nnever tested anything remotely like it,\\xa0\\xa0 so this is the best speculation we\\xa0\\ndeveloped together with experts. For a brief moment a fireball of pure energy\\xa0\\nappears, up to 50 kilometres in diameter, larger\\xa0\\xa0 than the visible horizon. It radiates blistering\\xa0\\nheat at the speed of light. Everything within 400\\xa0\\xa0 km is instantly set on fire – every tree, house,\\xa0\\nperson. The energy would reach much further, but\\xa0\\xa0 the explosion is so big that the Earth’s horizon\\xa0\\ncurves away from it. The surrounding deserts turn\\xa0\\xa0 into a field of glass. Then comes the blast wave.\\xa0\\nThe atmosphere above the explosion is violently\\xa0\\xa0 shot into space, a magnitude 9 earthquake\\xa0\\nshakes the United States while the sound of\\xa0\\xa0 the blast reverberates around the world. North\\xa0\\nAmerican forests burn, adding their soot to the\\xa0\\xa0 bomb’s radioactive fallout to create toxic death\\xa0\\nclouds that shroud the world like a dark curtain. Sundial is like a nuclear war happening all at\\xa0\\nonce. But it's more like a giant volcano erupting\\xa0\\xa0 or an asteroid striking, than a nuclear war.\\xa0\\nSundial would bring about an apocalyptic nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 winter, where global temperatures suddenly drop by\\xa0\\n10°C, most water sources would be contaminated and\\xa0\\xa0 crops would fail everywhere. Most people in the\\xa0\\nworld would die. So uhm. Congratulations, you won? Good News! Wait no, Bad News! The good news is that Sundial was never\\xa0\\nbuilt. Most details are still top secret.\\xa0\\xa0 But we know that scientists reacted with\\xa0\\nhorror and politicians who were secretly\\xa0\\xa0 informed responded with disbelief.\\xa0\\nEven the US Military thought this\\xa0\\xa0 was a bit much. In the insane world of\\xa0\\nnuclear arms, this madness was too much,\\xa0\\xa0 building it considered a crime against\\xa0\\nhumanity. And it had other problems too. A single apocalypse weapon leaves you no wiggle\\xa0\\nroom. Would you press the button if enemy soldiers\\xa0\\xa0 crossed a distant country’s borders or attacked\\xa0\\none of your distant bases? Would you end the world\\xa0\\xa0 if your rival overthrew a friendly government?\\xa0\\nCan you protect an ally with a bomb that would\\xa0\\xa0 kill them too? The elephant in the room is that\\xa0\\nwhile Sundial is clearly insane – humanity still\\xa0\\xa0 kind of did build it. At the peak of the\\xa0\\ncold war humanity had over 70,000 nukes.\\xa0\\xa0 Even today we still have about 12,000 nuclear\\xa0\\nweapons, enough to destroy human civilization. Instead of a single world burner, the\\xa0\\nsuperpowers built tens of thousands of\\xa0\\xa0 nuclear weapons of all types and sizes. Hidden\\xa0\\nin submarines or waiting in bunkers and silos.\\xa0\\xa0 And this sounds so much more reasonable,\\xa0\\ndoesn’t it? But this also makes them a much\\xa0\\xa0 more credible threat. Because if people feel\\xa0\\nthey can risk setting off a smaller nuke, they\\xa0\\xa0 might actually get launched. And we don’t know\\xa0\\nwhat kind of chain reaction this might trigger.\\xa0 So in reality the difference between\\xa0\\nSundial and what we have today is not\\xa0\\xa0 even that big. Humanity didn’t build a\\xa0\\ndoomsday bomb but a doomsday machine. Today the world may be on the verge of another\\xa0\\nnuclear arms race. The US is on track to spend\\xa0\\xa0 a trillion dollars on nuclear modernization\\xa0\\nprograms while China is expanding its arsenal\\xa0\\xa0 and might have more than 1000 nuclear\\xa0\\nweapons ready to be deployed by 2030. So\\xa0\\xa0 far we've escaped the existential threat these\\xa0\\nweapons pose – but if an alien visited earth,\\xa0\\xa0 it might ask us if we are ok and need\\xa0\\na hug. We should ask ourselves as a\\xa0\\xa0 species if we really want to be ready to\\xa0\\ndestroy ourselves at a moment's notice. Phew, that was a lot. Science is never \\ninherently good or bad.

One of our favourite fun facts, used in our\\xa0\\nbook and app and a video and… wait… 100,000 kilometers is like...\\nlike a lot. We’ve used it so often but where did we get this number\\xa0\\nfrom? And how do we know it\\'s true? Welcome to an epic RESEARCH RIDDLE\\xa0\\nthat took us well over a year to figure out and led us on a strange and baffling\\xa0\\njourney. It began extremely innocently. We always collect interesting and fun facts to\\xa0\\nmake our stories more colorful. And this one was just perfect! All of your blood vessels, twice\\xa0\\naround the world! Small thing, big number: wow! But one day someone asked where this number\\xa0\\nwas actually from. Did it really matter though, because it had to be true. If you google\\xa0\\nvariations of “how long are your blood vessels put together” you’ll find the same numbers over\\xa0\\nand over: 100,000 kilometers or 60,000 miles. You find it in books, blogs, webpages of\\xa0\\neducational institutions or lecture notes, reviews, scientific papers and articles.\\xa0\\nWe ourselves have used it multiple times. So it couldn\\'t be that hard to \\nfind the source,\\xa0right? RIGHT? The first perplexing thing we noticed was that\\xa0\\nnot a single one of the many, many websites, books or articles quoted the original\\xa0\\nsource. Most didn’t give a source at all, some linked to each other. It seemed like\\xa0\\nthe number was just accepted as a truism. Very weird. Even worse and more suspicious\\xa0\\nwas that the number was used inconsistently: some said it’s the total length of capillaries,\\xa0\\nsome said it’s just veins plus arteries, and others cited it as the length\\xa0\\nof everything put together. Hm. Something wasn\\'t right. We couldn\\'t let this\\xa0\\ngo. Getting our facts straight is critical for what we do here and since we’ve used this\\xa0\\nfact ourselves a few times this now felt personal. We needed to find the original\\xa0\\nsource and solve this research riddle. There HAD to be an ORIGINAL source! Random googling just turned up thousands\\xa0\\nof sites that quoted the number, no lead to the original. So we moved on to PUBMED, a\\xa0\\nsearch engine for biomedical science papers. 0 results. Ok weird. Maybe if we tried \\na\\xa0few different key word combinations. Nothing. Hm. Hm. Ok finally, we found a bunch of\\xa0\\nscientific papers! But still, not a single one referenced the original source. The number also showed up in two\\xa0\\ndifferent biology textbooks. We contacted the authors but they told us\\xa0\\nthat the number has been circulating for decades and they\\'d also be curious\\n to know where it comes from. Maybe we needed to go back to the olden days – so\\xa0\\nwe narrowed our search to the last few decades, starting with the 1990s. And would\\xa0\\nyou look at that…. we found two books! “Vital Circuits” by Steven Vogel. And\\xa0\\n“Looking at the Body” by David Suzuki. And it turned out Dr Suzuki is an OG science\\xa0\\ncommunicator with a PHD in Zoology, who started doing popular programming in the 1970s on Canadian\\xa0\\ntelevision. He has 29 honorary degrees and has written 52 books. Impressive! He may either be\\xa0\\nthe original source or at least know what it is! So we ordered “Looking at the Body”\\xa0\\nto look for it… And here it is: “… If all the body’s blood vessels were\\xa0\\nlaid end to end, they would stretch 96,000 km (60,000 miles). That’s about two\\xa0\\nand a half times around the world. … ” But again. No source. It turned out\\xa0\\nhe’s still around doing things in his late 80s – so we thought maybe\\xa0\\nif we ask Dr. Suzuki personally, he might know where the number is from. He had no\\xa0\\npublic email but ”A personal inquiry is possible by writing a letter to Dr. Suzuki.” Very old\\xa0\\nschool, very respectable. So we wrote a letter! Dear Dr. Suzuki, we are writing to you on a matter of grave\\xa0\\nimportance. What is the original source for the 100,000 km? Our internet video and\\xa0\\nour sanity depend on it. Pretty please. Respectfully yours, kurzgesagt fact checkers. Three weeks later we actually got a reply: “Dear weird internet people,\\nunfortunately Dr. Suzuki does not recall the source of this data. And since the book\\xa0\\nwas written over 30 years ago, he doesn\\'t have files that old available to look it up. Good luck\\xa0\\nwith your project, you are going to need it. Kind regards,\\nPublic Information Coordinator” Ok they didn\\'t quite use these words and\\xa0\\nwere actually really nice! But still: bummer. Maybe the 1992 popular-science\\xa0\\nbook by Steven Vogel, a Duke University biomechanics professor would\\xa0\\nbe more helpful. It has this sentence: “Combined length of pipes: 100,000 kilometers (60,000 miles)—more than twice\\xa0\\naround the earth at the equator.” So the book talks about this on one of \\nits 300 pages. But where is the source? Unfortunately there\\'s only\\xa0a list of 93 references and \\nsources with\\xa0no indication where in the book they\\'re pointing to. Our original source may be in one\\xa0\\nof the papers, books and articles in this list. Ouch. Reading all of those would take weeks. Was\\xa0\\nthis really worth it? Or had we gotten lost in the forest of human knowledge, looking for answers\\xa0\\nto questions nobody is asking and nobody cares about? But we’d wasted so much time already,\\xa0\\nso we decided to just do that one by one. And now for a change we just got stupidly lucky.\\xa0\\nFor no particular reason we decided to check the sources from last to first. And it turned out\\xa0\\nthe very source we checked first, was what we were looking for! A Scientific American article\\xa0\\nfrom 1959: “The Microcirculation of the Blood”. So we got a scan of this 65 year old science\\xa0\\nmagazine and there it was – but this was still not the original source. But it did reference where it\\xa0\\ngot the number from. “The Anatomy and Physiology of Capillaries” – a 1922 book by August Krogh,\\xa0\\nwinner of a Nobel Prize for Medicine. He probably knew what he was talking about. So we ordered\\xa0\\nhis book and bingo: we got the original source. The book is a collection of Krogh’s\\xa0\\nlectures and was highly praised by experts at the time. It summarises his research\\xa0\\nand adds new experiments, ideas and hypotheses. So here it was. The original source, used\\xa0\\nthousands of times for over a century: Supposing a man\\'s muscles to weigh 50 kg \\nand his capillaries to number 2000 per sq. mm., the total length of all these tubes put\\xa0\\ntogether must be something like 100,000 kilometers or 2 ½ times round the globe\\xa0\\nand their total surface 6300 sq. meters. While other scientists had speculated on\\xa0\\nthe length of all the capillaries before, Krogh was the first to make a real estimate,\\xa0\\nbased on real experiments. Something very solid. Ok. And now that we were here – was it correct? Krogh’s book includes this rather cryptic table, without calculations or explanations. It\\xa0\\nseems to have been obvious to him but not to us looking at it a century later.\\xa0\\nWe needed to actually read the book. Book reading montage (maybe Zeitraffer) In a very breakthrough sciency kind of\\xa0\\nway, Krogh just winged it. In a nutshell, he cut muscle samples from different animals,\\xa0\\nstarted counting and made some rule of thumb assumptions. Today we know that his assumptions\\xa0\\nabout the density of capillaries in humans was quite off. On top of that, he used a kind of\\xa0\\nidealised body builder human, weighing 143 kg with 50 kg of pure muscle mass. And this finally\\xa0\\ngave him the very pleasing number of 100,000 km. It would be unfair to blame Krogh – this was just\\xa0\\na small ancilliary fact he probably calculated for fun and out of curiosity, not elemental to\\xa0\\nhis body of work. But he was a world expert, so his incorrect number was used\\xa0\\nin scientific papers, spread and became dogma, eventually entirely\\xa0\\ndetached from the original source. At this point in our research, over a year\\xa0\\nhad passed. So just to be sure, we did another google search and… While we were caught up\\xa0\\nin our personal mission to find the source, up to the neck in old books, writing letters to\\xa0\\nCanada – scientists quietly published a paper, not really getting a lot of attention from\\xa0\\nanybody. They calculated a new number, a way more accurate estimate. If we had just waited another\\xa0\\nyear, we could have saved doing all that work. The deepest of sighs So now, here it is: According\\xa0\\nto the newest science, the length of all the capillaries\\xa0\\nin a human is somewhere between 9000 and 19,000 km. Very impressive but\\xa0\\nnot enough to go around the world. A Sort of Conclusion If you look up the question today, \\nyou\\'ll likely still not find the real answer but thousands of sources,\\xa0\\namong them one kurzgesagt video, using the wrong number. And it will \\nprobably\\xa0stay like that for a while. In all this time, why did nobody bother to\\xa0\\ndouble check this? Well because the reality is, it’s extremely hard and time consuming. As\\xa0\\nwe mentioned before it took us a year and a great deal of luck to get to the bottom\\xa0\\nof this on our own. Investing this time and effort while you’re writing a paper is\\xa0\\njust not feasible for most scientists or science communicators. If a number seems\\xa0\\nsafe and is used by credible sources, most people, including us, end up\\xa0\\nquoting a secondary source or worse. Also: it’s just such a nice, round\\xa0\\nnumber that will stick with you once you’ve heard it. Facts that seem\\xa0\\nbeautiful tend to survive much longer. But that is exactly the problem, isn’t it? The\\xa0\\nmost interesting stories survive on the internet and often with each retelling, they get more\\xa0\\nexciting and memorable. It takes a lot of energy to get to the bottom of things, and a factoid is\\xa0\\neasily repeated, so misinformation can persist. When we started this research we didn’t\\xa0\\nthink we’d end up here.

So without minimising the darkness,\\xa0\\xa0 we want to add a story that we find\\xa0\\nhelpful for dealing with the world.\\xa0\\xa0 This is subjective and not a science\\xa0\\nvideo, so you don’t need to buy into it. Our story begins with the\\xa0\\nfirst moment that ever was. 14 billion years ago time and space began from\\xa0\\nsome kind of state of pure energy. From this\\xa0\\xa0 very first moment the universe grew\\xa0\\nand evolved. Things that were one\\xa0\\xa0 became many. Energy turned into forces and\\xa0\\nparticles, out of chaos emerged the laws of\\xa0\\xa0 nature. From these ingredients stars arose,\\xa0\\ngigantic engines, turning simple stuff into\\xa0\\xa0 complex stuff only to die violently\\xa0\\nand spread the new complexity around. Out of this more complex stuff,\\xa0\\nnew stars and more worlds emerged,\\xa0\\xa0 repeating the cycle until most of the simple\\xa0\\nstuff was used up and most stars that will\\xa0\\xa0 ever be born had been born. And then, on one\\xa0\\nplanet, where the conditions were just right,\\xa0\\xa0 dead particles and molecules combined to make\\xa0\\nanother jump in complexity. Maybe the laws that\\xa0\\xa0 govern everything were destined to make life\\xa0\\nhappen. Maybe it was just a cosmic dice throw. But life, now the most complex thing in existence,\\xa0\\nwasted no time and spread to even the tiniest\\xa0\\xa0 corners. For billions of years cells held on,\\xa0\\nfighting against the elements and each other,\\xa0\\xa0 evolving in the process. Until one day they came\\xa0\\ntogether and made another jump in complexity,\\xa0\\xa0 to plants, animals and fungi. First\\xa0\\nin the oceans, then on the land. Earth was now the stage of something grand,\\xa0\\na complexity acceleration machine going at\\xa0\\xa0 full speed. Millions of new species emerged and\\xa0\\nvanished. Life was beaten down over and over,\\xa0\\xa0 but every time it came back stronger. Resettling\\xa0\\nniches filled with corpses of the ones that came\\xa0\\xa0 before. Most of these beings are hidden in\\xa0\\ntime forever, we only know their faint echoes. Until a few million years ago an animal\\xa0\\nlooked at the night sky. It looked at its\\xa0\\xa0 hands. It saw its reflection in a puddle. And it\\xa0\\nrealised it existed. That it was alive. Here and\\xa0\\xa0 now. You probably had such a moment as a small\\xa0\\nchild, mundane and majestic at the same time.\\xa0 This is where the human story begins, about\\xa0\\nsix million years ago, with the hominins.\\xa0\\xa0 Still just another animal among many others.\\xa0\\nThey split into many families and lineages\\xa0\\xa0 evolving further or disappearing again. But for\\xa0\\nsome reason their evolutionary niche enabled\\xa0\\xa0 their brains to grow and they learned more about\\xa0\\nthis strange world. They prayed to the stars,\\xa0\\xa0 they tamed fire and turned stones into tools.\\xa0\\nThey celebrated and cried together. Life was\\xa0\\xa0 hard and brutally short but together they\\xa0\\nendured – probably by telling themselves\\xa0\\xa0 stories about the world. For almost 250,000\\xa0\\ngenerations they built a biological foundation. And then, at some point 200,000\\xa0\\nyears or about 10,000 generations\\xa0\\xa0 ago they became us. Humanity had arrived. Our ancestors did not waste any time.\\xa0\\nTheir world was still hard and unforgiving,\\xa0\\xa0 but out of pure stubbornness they did not\\xa0\\naccept that. They wanted their lives to be\\xa0\\xa0 better. So they made better tools and learned to\\xa0\\npreserve their knowledge beyond death. Progress\\xa0\\xa0 started slow. And then suddenly they (or better WE) \\nmade the planet our own. Agriculture and\\xa0\\xa0 the first villages and temples snowballed\\xa0\\ninto civilization. Kingdoms and empires,\\xa0\\xa0 technology, writing, astronomy, medicine,\\xa0\\nphilosophy. A hot second later, science,\\xa0\\xa0 industrialization, the modern world,\\xa0\\nthe information age where we are today. Earth is truly ours now. We changed it in ways unfathomable a few\\xa0\\nshort generations ago. We turned the land\\xa0\\xa0 into fields worked by millions of machines,\\xa0\\nbuilt thousands of gigantic jungles made of\\xa0\\xa0 sand and metal. We split the atom and travelled\\xa0\\nto other worlds. Everything is different today. Except us of course. We humans have\\xa0\\nnot changed. We were molded by a\\xa0\\xa0 cold and unforgiving world, where\\xa0\\nwe needed to be hard and brutal\\xa0\\xa0 to survive. We are all still bound to\\xa0\\nour nature that made us so successful. We still tell stories, are hungry\\xa0\\nfor food, greedy for resources,\\xa0\\xa0 desperate to be accepted by our peers. We are\\xa0\\nscared by the dangers that lurk in the dark,\\xa0\\xa0 imagined and real ones. We are still brutal to\\xa0\\neach other and the animals we hold power over.\\xa0\\xa0 We are still territorial and possessive,\\xa0\\nwe fear losing what we have, and we fear\\xa0\\xa0 change. We downplay the damage we cause and\\xa0\\nignore the people in need outside our tribes. Humans are not nice and if we look at our\\xa0\\nhistory, how could we expect ourselves to\\xa0\\xa0 be? In nature we see great beauty but\\xa0\\nalso endless violence and struggle,\\xa0\\xa0 devoid of morals or kindness. We are an instinct\\xa0\\ndriven apex predator that survived in an uncaring\\xa0\\xa0 world, only now we have coal plants,\\xa0\\nnuclear weapons and social media. This would be hard to handle for any animal,\\xa0\\xa0 so it makes sense that we continue to follow\\xa0\\nthe impulses so deeply ingrained in us. But\\xa0\\xa0 this is only because we have not yet caught up\\xa0\\nwith the mind numbing gift we have been handed. The real tragedy of humanity today is that\\xa0\\nwe are these amazingly powerful beings that\\xa0\\xa0 have not awoken to their potential. We are\\xa0\\ntrapped in the present and the mindset of a\\xa0\\xa0 scarce world. But aside from the physical\\xa0\\nlimits of the universe there is nothing\\xa0\\xa0 stopping us from creating a literal paradise\\xa0\\nfor ourselves. This seems so daft, but it is\\xa0\\xa0 true. If we dare to tell ourselves a different\\xa0\\nstory about who we are and who we could be. Humans throughout history felt like\\xa0\\nthey would witness the apocalypse and\\xa0\\xa0 this feels especially true today, but you are\\xa0\\nprobably not living in the end times. There is\\xa0\\xa0 a solid chance that humanity will persist\\xa0\\nfor thousands, maybe millions of years. If this might be the very start of our history,\\xa0\\xa0 what can we dream of achieving? Just like our\\xa0\\nvery first ancestors six million years ago,\\xa0\\xa0 we may be the ancestors of another 250,000\\xa0\\ngenerations of people. But while the hominins\\xa0\\xa0 found themselves powerless in a world they\\xa0\\nhad to adapt to, our starting conditions\\xa0\\xa0 could not be more different. It’s like we got\\xa0\\nhanded a save file of a game where others put\\xa0\\xa0 in millions of hours of work – and where we can\\xa0\\ndecide what game we want to play in the future. The world is still horrible. And it\\xa0\\nis also the best world that has ever\\xa0\\xa0 existed. And we can make it so much better. An optimistic person living in the year 1924\\xa0\\nwould not believe the progress we have made\\xa0\\xa0 in just a century. How much we reduced\\xa0\\npoverty, how many diseases we cured,\\xa0\\xa0 how much free time we have, what kind of luxuries\\xa0\\nare ordinary to us, what technological wonders\\xa0\\xa0 we take for granted, how few of us die\\xa0\\nin war, how many live in a democracy. And today we might very well be gearing up for\\xa0\\na jump like our ancestors 10,000 years ago,\\xa0\\xa0 when agriculture changed everything for\\xa0\\neverybody. From AI possibly transforming\\xa0\\xa0 the information age, to biotechnology enabling\\xa0\\nus to manipulate the language of life itself,\\xa0\\xa0 to new sustainable ways of\\xa0\\nharvesting the energy we crave. If we start thinking in decades and centuries,\\xa0\\nit is perfectly reasonable that we will solve\\xa0\\xa0 our problems. We can eliminate poverty, maybe all\\xa0\\nmaterial needs. Defeat all diseases, maybe even\\xa0\\xa0 death itself. We have the potential to restore\\xa0\\nbalance to the climate and heal the planet again.\\xa0\\xa0 We may be able to adapt to the information\\xa0\\nage and make lasting peace. None of this is\\xa0\\xa0 guaranteed and it will be hard and full of\\xa0\\nfailure and setbacks. Some things will get\\xa0\\xa0 worse before they get better. We will run\\xa0\\nup against our nature over and over again. But if we manage to clean up our act\\xa0\\nwe could create a world better than we\\xa0\\xa0 dare hope for. You get to do that. You get\\xa0\\nto live in a world that is deeply flawed\\xa0\\xa0 but also the best it ever was. And you\\xa0\\nget the opportunity to make it better. A world with the smallest amount of\\xa0\\nsuffering possible, that fits our nature and\\xa0\\xa0 inspires us to be the best version of ourselves.', \"We’ve found a new planet, home to octillions\\xa0\\nof the most extreme beings living in the\\xa0\\xa0 most absurd and deadly hellscape. In absolute\\xa0\\ndarkness, crushed by the weight of mountains,\\xa0\\xa0 starved of oxygen, cooked alive, bathed\\xa0\\nin acid, salt or radiation. And yet,\\xa0\\xa0 they live for thousands, perhaps\\xa0\\nmillions of years! It turns out,\\xa0\\xa0 this planet is not in space –––\\xa0\\nit is inside the crust of Earth! This is the deep biosphere and\\xa0\\nwe basically learned that it\\xa0\\xa0 exists yesterday. Its volume is at least\\xa0\\ntwice as large as all the Earth’s oceans,\\xa0\\xa0 home to more microbes than the rest of\\xa0\\nthe entire planet.Their total biomass\\xa0\\xa0 is more than 20 times greater than all\\xa0\\nhumans, livestock, and animal wildlife. Let’s descend into this mad,\\xa0\\xa0 deadly world where none of the rules we\\xa0\\nthought are mandatory for life apply. Going Deeper and Deeper Deep life seems to be everywhere we\\xa0\\nlook: below the oceans, near volcanoes,\\xa0\\xa0 beneath the glaciers of Antarctica, under any\\xa0\\nlandscape we can imagine and anywhere we live. We’ll use a special duck science drill and\\xa0\\nstart our journey in familiar territory:\\xa0\\xa0 on land, in the soil, where plants grow\\xa0\\nand animals roam. If earth were an onion,\\xa0\\xa0 this is the very top of the very top layer.\\xa0\\nSoil is a lavish four-way partnership of air,\\xa0\\xa0 water, minerals and organic matter, bathed\\xa0\\nin endless energy. Life lives in luxury here. Plants exploit this paradise and produce more\\xa0\\nthan 30 times the biomass of all of Earth’s\\xa0\\xa0 animals each year, in a constant cycle of growth\\xa0\\nand decay. Only a tiny fraction of the biomass is\\xa0\\xa0 buried deeper in the ground, supplying juicy\\xa0\\nresources for almost half a billion years. As we dig deeper, most of the\\xa0\\nair has been squeezed out and\\xa0\\xa0 we cross the water table into a\\xa0\\nzone saturated with groundwater,\\xa0\\xa0 rich in minerals and some organic matter. Roots\\xa0\\nfrom the most ambitious plants reach down here,\\xa0\\xa0 and the most common inhabitants are\\xa0\\nscavengers living off decay. This\\xa0\\xa0 layer can be pretty cold because it is still\\xa0\\nslowly warming up from the most recent ice age. Klunk We reach bedrock. A foundation of solid rock for\\xa0\\nall the less solid stuff above, home to fractures\\xa0\\xa0 filled with water . It can be exposed to the\\xa0\\nsurface, or buried hundreds of meters below stuff. Here, in the dense bedrock, we’re in a weird\\xa0\\nplanet inside the planet. The most thrilling\\xa0\\xa0 zone of the deep biosphere. As we drill further\\xa0\\ndown, temperatures gradually begin to rise,\\xa0\\xa0 and soon it gets really hot and the pressure\\xa0\\nrises. Underneath 400 meters of rock,\\xa0\\xa0 the pressure is similar to the surface of\\xa0\\nVenus. We drill faster now, down to 1000 meters,\\xa0\\xa0 deeper than the Burj Khalifa is tall. It is about\\xa0\\n30°C , and there is almost no free oxygen left. We continue and finally stop almost\\xa0\\n4 kilometers down. Above us pressing\\xa0\\xa0 solid rock weighing tens of thousands of\\xa0\\ntons with pressures as intense as at the\\xa0\\xa0 bottom of the Mariana Trench. Down here it is on\\xa0\\naverage 120 degrees C , even hotter if a magma\\xa0\\xa0 plume is nearby. The heat is a leftover from\\xa0\\nEarth's formation and from from the decay of\\xa0\\xa0 radioactive elements like thorium and uranium\\xa0\\nthat shower the crust with a constant wave of\\xa0\\xa0 radioactivity. To make things worse some rocks\\xa0\\nare mixed with extreme amounts of salt. Hell. And yet. Life is thriving. Inside rock! If we zoom\\xa0\\nin, we see that solid rock is not actually solid!\\xa0\\xa0 It’s traversed by cracks, voids and tiny pores.\\xa0\\nSandstone, limestone or basalt are so porous that\\xa0\\xa0 up to 40 percent of their volume is actually empty\\xa0\\nspace. But even much denser rocks like granite,\\xa0\\xa0 can be split open by cracks and fractures.\\xa0\\nWe’ve found a gigantic planet spanning\\xa0\\xa0 system of micro-caves, free real estate\\xa0\\nfilled with water and hardcore microbes! And these caves are moving. Just like the atmosphere is constantly mixing\\xa0\\nair to create weather, down here rocks are\\xa0\\xa0 mixing to create rock weather. Submerged\\xa0\\nmountain ranges are shifting and ripping,\\xa0\\xa0 crashing and merging. Continents\\xa0\\nsmash into each other with the\\xa0\\xa0 energy of millions of nuclear weapons\\xa0\\nbut as slow as your fingernails grow. Countless tiny and not so tiny earthquakes\\xa0\\nrip open tiny new fissures and passageways,\\xa0\\xa0 creating new spaces for life and closing others\\xa0\\noff forever. In this hot, moving pressure cooker,\\xa0\\xa0 minerals are forged and baked, and\\xa0\\norganic molecules are created and\\xa0\\xa0 destroyed. An insane menu for anyone\\xa0\\nbrave enough to try to survive down\\xa0\\xa0 here. Let us venture into the system\\xa0\\nof tiny caves and meet some of them. The Most Extreme Living Things We think that octillions\\xa0\\nof microbes live down here,\\xa0\\xa0 and naturally they are pretty hardcore.\\xa0\\nThe doomsday preppers of the underworld. Some have big, bulky genomes, living entirely on\\xa0\\ntheir own, basically forming their own ecosystem. Like the bacterium Desulforudis audaxviator.\\xa0\\nIt synthesises its own food by nibbling carbon\\xa0\\xa0 or sulfur from the rock and turning it into\\xa0\\norganic substances. If the conditions get\\xa0\\xa0 too extreme or if there is no food around,\\xa0\\nit kills itself to survive, by forming an\\xa0\\xa0 endospore. It divides into a big and a small part,\\xa0\\nand swallows the small part again, forming a cell,\\xa0\\xa0 within a cell. The outer cell then sheds its\\xa0\\nwater and kills itself, leaving the spore to\\xa0\\xa0 float around, maybe for thousands of years until\\xa0\\nit finds a good place to spring to life again.\\n \\xa0 Others like some company, like the archaea\\xa0\\nwith the clunky name Altiarchaeum hamiconexum,\\xa0\\xa0 that have a rare double membrane covered in\\xa0\\nweird materials that protect them against\\xa0\\xa0 the extremes. They shoot out nano-sized\\xa0\\ngrappling hooks to tether themselves and\\xa0\\xa0 seem to live in cracks and fissures filled\\xa0\\nwith water completely devoid of oxygen,\\xa0\\xa0 harvest carbon dioxide to create\\xa0\\nbiomass, and may sort of eat hydrogen. The conditions in the deep biosphere are so\\xa0\\nharsh that other microbes share the hard work\\xa0\\xa0 by forming consortia. They knit themselves\\xa0\\ntogether in a biofilm – a very thin, sticky\\xa0\\xa0 net that shields them against the extremes. They\\xa0\\nare miniature cells, often with a small genome,\\xa0\\xa0 but each good at one thing. One type of microbe\\xa0\\neats methane and excretes its electrons. A second\\xa0\\xa0 type eats these electrons and converts sulphate\\xa0\\ninto sulfite that is then eaten by a third microbe\\xa0\\xa0 and so on. Some eat iron, others use electrons\\xa0\\nto turn nitrogen or carbon dioxide into biomass. Life down here found ways to use stuff that\\xa0\\nis poisonous to most animals to make food and\\xa0\\xa0 energy. But still, life is incredibly hard and\\xa0\\nresources and energy are super hard to come by.\\xa0\\xa0 So the most intense strategy for survival\\xa0\\ndown here is to live forever. Like monks\\xa0\\xa0 who’ve taken a vow of poverty, deep microbes\\xa0\\nconsume very little and conserve their energy. Their metabolism is up to a million times\\xa0\\nslower than microbes at the surface. They\\xa0\\xa0 had a meal when you were born and are still\\xa0\\ndigesting it. For most of their life they exist\\xa0\\xa0 in a slow limbo – some even slowly cannibalise\\xa0\\nthemselves. Until a sudden influx of resources\\xa0\\xa0 arrives by pure chance – and then they spring\\xa0\\ninto action and reproduce. With this lifestyle\\xa0\\xa0 it seems that extreme microbes can live for\\xa0\\ncenturies, maybe even for millions of years! If they are not hunted to death, of course.\\xa0\\nBecause kilometers deep in limestone habitats,\\xa0\\xa0 there seem to be spaces big enough for\\xa0\\nmulticellular predators. We found asexual worms,\\xa0\\xa0 100 times longer than microbes, hunting\\xa0\\nand devouring bacteria. It's not clear\\xa0\\xa0 if they originated down here or if\\xa0\\nmini earthquakes opened up fractures\\xa0\\xa0 for water to carry them into the deep.\\xa0\\nBut there are other fierce predators\\xa0\\xa0 like rotifers or arthropods in the\\xa0\\ndepths, hunting immortal microbes. We wish we could tell you more insane things\\xa0\\nabout life in the deep biosphere but there is\\xa0\\xa0 a problem. We don’t know that much yet. For one,\\xa0\\nwe can not really get a good look under kilometers\\xa0\\xa0 of rock. Drilling down could contaminate\\xa0\\nthe samples with microbes from the surface. We found living ones in deep mines\\xa0\\nand brought them into the lab. But\\xa0\\xa0 it is pretty hard to simulate the conditions\\xa0\\nthey feel comfy in – in boiling hot water,\\xa0\\xa0 squeezed under mountains, submerged in\\xa0\\ndeadly chemicals – and still see them\\xa0\\xa0 through a microscope. And the microbes live so\\xa0\\nslowly, for so long that nothing might happen. A lot of what we know about them we\\xa0\\ngot from turning them into a slurry\\xa0\\xa0 and looking at what their genes could do.\\xa0\\nLike “breathing” nitrogen or eating methane. We know that the diversity of life in the deep\\xa0\\nbiosphere must be staggering and that some of\\xa0\\xa0 the most hardcore and extreme beings live down\\xa0\\nthere. This is a proper frontier of science,\\xa0\\xa0 super hard to study and most of\\xa0\\nwhat we know we learned in just\\xa0\\xa0 the last 20 years. There is so much\\xa0\\nmore undiscovered mystery for us,\\xa0\\xa0 that could bring us progress in\\xa0\\nmedicine, energy, the climate, and more. Let’s end by moving our gaze from the inside\\xa0\\nto the outside again. Since we now know how\\xa0\\xa0 extremely large the deep biosphere is and how\\xa0\\nlife down there survives without light, oxygen,\\xa0\\xa0 sane temperatures or not being covered\\xa0\\nin poison… could there be deep biospheres\\xa0\\xa0 all over the universe? Maybe all you need is a\\xa0\\nplanet or moon with internal heat or radiation. And a chemical composition that allows\\xa0\\nmicrobes to build the parts they need.\\xa0\\xa0 Some scientists suggest that there could\\xa0\\nbe ten of them in the solar system,\\xa0\\xa0 hiding beneath a seemingly dead and\\xa0\\nfrozen surface. So as we learn more\\xa0\\xa0 and more about the life below our feet, we may\\xa0\\naccidentally learn about life in the universe. You're lucky. YOU dont need to drill dozens\\xa0\\nof kilometers through solid rock to discover\\xa0\\xa0 something mindblowing.

A new frontier of sci\\xa0 ence, something truly new that\\xa0\\nwe are only just beginning to\\xa0\\xa0 understand. Let us dive into the\\xa0\\nwild world of the human virome. You are an Ecosystem You're a living, breathing ecosystem made of up\\xa0\\nto 40 trillion cells. This metropolis of flesh is\\xa0\\xa0 home to the human microbiome, another 40 trillion\\xa0\\nbacteria that have a contract with your body:\\xa0\\xa0 They get to live here and in return they\\xa0\\nbreak down your meals. They synthesise\\xa0\\xa0 vitamins in your gut, neutralise acid in\\xa0\\nyour mouth, help balance your immune system,\\xa0\\xa0 and they take up space preventing\\xa0\\nharmful bacteria from getting in. This is a fragile balance – bacteria really\\xa0\\nonly look out for themselves, multiplying\\xa0\\xa0 and testing their boundaries.\\xa0\\nTo keep their numbers in check,\\xa0\\xa0 your body's ecosystem needs\\xa0\\na group of deadly predators: Viruses. At least ten trillion. They're literally everywhere in your body,\\xa0\\ntens of thousands of different species. At least a few trillion live in your gut,\\xa0\\nwhere also most of your resident bacteria\\xa0\\xa0 are. At least 18 billion on your skin,\\xa0\\n100 million in each drop of your saliva,\\xa0\\xa0 dozens of millions in your urinary tract.\\xa0\\nEven in a single drop of the cerebrospinal\\xa0\\xa0 fluid surrounding your nerves and brain,\\xa0\\nresearchers found up to 10,000 viruses. While this sounds like a horrible idea at first,\\xa0\\xa0 at least in the gut, around 97% of\\xa0\\nthem are bacteriophages, or phages,\\xa0\\xa0 bizarre creatures that are specialised in\\xa0\\nhunting down and killing resident bacteria\\xa0\\xa0 and are not able to infect your cells. Instead\\xa0\\nthey kill trillions of bacteria every single day. Together these viruses make up the human\\xa0\\nvirome – a symbiotic virus ecosystem that\\xa0\\xa0 is completely unique to you and that seems\\xa0\\nto be crucial for your health. Let’s get to\\xa0\\xa0 know them and see how they support you\\xa0\\n– and what happens if things go wrong. The Silent Mass Murderers of Your Body Inside your gut, a stealthy Lambda Phage\\xa0\\nfloats through the buzzing crowds of bacteria,\\xa0\\xa0 looking for a victim. It has six legs, a long thin\\xa0\\nbody and a big head, made of geometric shapes,\\xa0\\xa0 filled with genetic material. Each species is\\xa0\\nspecialized in hunting one specific species\\xa0\\xa0 of bacteria and ignores all others.\\xa0\\nLambda is looking for Escherichia coli. This versatile bacteria is numerous in your\\xa0\\ngut, usually a good boy synthesising vitamins\\xa0\\xa0 for you. But it also has a dark side – some of\\xa0\\nthem would much rather live inside your flesh\\xa0\\xa0 and feast on your resources. If there are too\\xa0\\nmany or if they manage to invade your tissue,\\xa0\\xa0 they can cause serious diseases. So one\\xa0\\nof the most important jobs of the virome\\xa0\\xa0 is to control the numbers of different\\xa0\\nbacteria populations. By killing them. Lambda has found a victim. Spider-like legs get\\xa0\\na hold of a bacteria and grip it hard. Like an\\xa0\\xa0 angry syringe it violently rams its sharp bottom\\xa0\\ninto the victim’s body and releases its DNA and Once inside, the proteins disable the\\xa0\\ndefenses of the bacterium. It is\\xa0now  a factory under new management. It\\xa0\\nis forced to build new viruses until\\xa0\\xa0 the victim is filled up and bursts open,\\xa0\\nreleasing a horde of fresh Lambda viruses. But its goal is not genocide. Phages need a healthy population of bacteria\\xa0\\nto survive. So sometimes they choose a way\\xa0\\xa0 more sinister tactic. Instead of killing their\\xa0\\nvictim, the virus integrates its DNA into the\\xa0\\xa0 genome of the bacteria and goes to sleep. When the\\xa0\\nbacteria multiplies, the virus DNA is multiplied\\xa0\\xa0 too. Until one day the viral DNA re-awakens and\\xa0\\nsuddenly decides to kill its unsuspecting victim. And here things become exciting – your\\xa0\\nvirome also needs you to thrive. It’s in\\xa0\\xa0 its best interest that you are healthy. So some\\xa0\\nviruses inject genes into bacteria that actively\\xa0\\xa0 make them support your body. Some force their\\xa0\\nbacteria hosts to support your gut’s mucus layer,\\xa0\\xa0 break down complex carbohydrates\\xa0\\nfrom your food more efficiently,\\xa0\\xa0 creating substances that\\xa0\\nprotect against inflammation. And they alter what signals bacteria send to your\\xa0\\nimmune cells. Basically they’re letting them know:\\xa0\\xa0 We have things under control, you\\xa0\\ncan chill out. This may prevent\\xa0\\xa0 allergic reactions or even protect\\xa0\\nyou against autoimmune diseases. But of course, there is also a dark side to\\xa0\\nthis story. Some viruses don’t care about\\xa0\\xa0 our health. Instead of helping they turn\\xa0\\nharmless bacteria into deadly monsters. When Viruses turn Bacteria into killers Some species of bacteriophage carry\\xa0\\ndangerous genes for toxic substances.\\xa0\\xa0 When they take over their hosts, they\\xa0\\ncan integrate into the genetic code of\\xa0\\xa0 the bacteria where they lay as a deadly gift.\\nLike the case of the Vibrio cholerae and the\\xa0\\xa0 CTXφ bacteriophage hunting them. Most\\xa0\\nstrains of the cholerae bacteria are\\xa0\\xa0 harmless and billions of them may live in your\\xa0\\ngut right now. When CTXφ infect the bacteria,\\xa0\\xa0 they gift them the genes for the cholera\\xa0\\ntoxin, which permanently becomes part of\\xa0\\xa0 their genetic lineage forever. It's\\xa0\\nlike handing a house cat a shotgun. Vibrio cholerae shower these toxins at the\\xa0\\ncells lining your gut, making them sick. They\\xa0\\xa0 vomit large amounts of salt, which pulls out\\xa0\\na flood of water into your intestines. This\\xa0\\xa0 causes explosive diarrhoea and vomiting,\\xa0\\ndraining your body of fluid. If untreated,\\xa0\\xa0 about half of patients die. But for the\\xa0\\nphage and bacteria this is great. They are\\xa0\\xa0 carried out of the body to infect more humans,\\xa0\\nspreading and multiplying further. This strain\\xa0\\xa0 of Vibrio cholerae is now a dangerous\\xa0\\nenemy of humanity thanks to this virus. Or the bacteria Staphylococcus aureus, which is\\xa0\\nhunted by the phage with the amazing name: φSa3ms. Usually the bacteria is mostly harmless\\xa0\\nand lives on your skin and inside your\\xa0\\xa0 nose. It doesn’t do anything useful per\\xa0\\nse, its main job is to take up space,\\xa0\\xa0 making it harder for hostile bacteria to\\xa0\\ncolonise your body. But φSa3ms can change this\\xa0\\xa0 quickly – it carries multiple dangerous genes,\\xa0\\nlike giving a cat flamethrowers and grenades. If such a modified Staphylococcus aureus\\xa0\\nbacteria gets into your body through a tiny cut,\\xa0\\xa0 it becomes extremely dangerous. One of its new\\xa0\\nweapons are superantigens, which basically is\\xa0\\xa0 like injecting your immune cells with cocaine.\\xa0\\nThe toxin completely breaks your carefully fine\\xa0\\xa0 tuned immune system. It activates all of your\\xa0\\nT cells, all at once and makes them flip out.\\xa0\\xa0 They release a tsunami of cytokines, activating\\xa0\\nall of your defenses at once. The infection is\\xa0\\xa0 flooded with cells that can’t fight the\\xa0\\nbacteria and cause heavy inflammation. Your broken and confused immune cells have a\\xa0\\nreally hard time fighting Staphylococcus aureus,\\xa0\\xa0 which now invades, penetrating deep into your\\xa0\\ntissue. Your body is trying to seal the wounds\\xa0\\xa0 and isolate the invader, but another new\\xa0\\nweapon it gained has the ability to just\\xa0\\xa0 dissolve the barriers and penetrate even deeper.\\xa0\\nBefore the onset of antibiotics an infection\\xa0\\xa0 with Staphylococcus aureus was very deadly and we\\xa0\\nhave φSa3ms to thank for making it even deadlier. But the viruses of our virome may also\\xa0\\ndirectly save your life – by killing cancer. Cancer Killing Viruses Oncolytic viruses specialize in hunting and\\xa0\\nkilling cancer – like the Newcastle Disease\\xa0\\xa0 virus or the Reovirus, who mostly ignore your\\xa0\\nhealthy cells and instead hunt down tumors.\\xa0\\xa0 Cancer cells are broken mutants that evolve\\xa0\\nvarious ways to hide and fight back against\\xa0\\xa0 your immune system. But as they get better\\xa0\\nat this, they get worse at other things,\\xa0\\xa0 like fighting back viruses. A weakness to\\xa0\\nbe exploited. Oncolytic viruses target the\\xa0\\xa0 specific adaptations of cancer cells, hitting\\xa0\\nthem where they are not ready to be hit. And worse for these cells, since their\\xa0\\ninternal machinery is compromised,\\xa0\\xa0 they can’t defend themselves. They are taken\\xa0\\nover and turned into virus production factories.\\xa0\\xa0 Eventually the new viruses leave the cancer cell,\\xa0\\noften killing it, and carry on infecting other\\xa0\\xa0 cancer cells nearby. This death and destruction\\xa0\\nis not subtle, and one side effect is that\\xa0\\xa0 it attracts immune cells that immediately\\xa0\\nbegin attacking the tumor with full force. What is even more impressive, these\\xa0\\nviruses seem to disrupt the artificial\\xa0\\xa0 environment that tumors create to keep\\xa0\\nyour immune system at bay.

Your body is a biological machine that follows\\xa0the laws of thermodynamics and needs energy and\\xa0raw materials to stay alive, which is why you eat.\\xa0 The energy from food is measured in calories and you need a certain amount \\nto power your internal\\xa0machines. Your brain thinks, your heart pumps, your gut digests, your immune system immuns. And you contract your muscles to move around. The harder a movement is, \\nthe more calories you\\xa0burn. An hour of walking burns about 260 calories,\\xa0 moderate swimming 430, biking 600, running 700. If you eat more calories than you burn, your\\xa0body stores them mostly in the form of fat.\\xa0\\xa0 One kilogram, or two pounds of fat\\n is about\\xa07000 calories. Seems simple. To lose weight, \\nyou have to burn more than you eat,\\xa0 so fat is turned back into energy. There are two ways to do this: Eating less –\\n which\\xa0we will cover in another video – and burning more,\\xa0 say by moving around aimlessly, also called\\xa0working out. We also get told early on that\\xa0\\nexercising is healthy somehow, so working\\xa0out should \\nkill two birds with one stone. Unfortunately this doesn’t exactly work out.\\xa0 It is one of these frustrating experiences\\xa0 where you do what you think is right only to\\xa0not see the results you deserve. In reality,\\xa0focusing on exercising is not\\xa0a reliable way to lose weight. Some studies show that \\nexercise\\xa0can lead to some fat loss,\\xa0 others that it is minimal. How\\xa0can this be? It turns out that until recently we fundamentally misunderstood what moving around a lot does to our bodies. Disclaimer: The science on fat loss\\xa0is complicated and many studies\\xa0compare vastly different populations, different\\xa0measurements and are complicated to understand.\\xa0\\xa0 And the online discussion is \\nfull of personal\\xa0anecdotes. This video covers general principles,\\xa0\\nbased on the current state of research.\\xa0 But when you look at the individual,\\xa0 there are variations – it matters if you are\\xa0an athlete \\nor casually try to lose weight. [The Myth of the Workout] A few years ago scientists began to compare\\xa0\\npopulations in industrialized societies,\\xa0which sit a lot, to hunter-gatherer\\xa0communities, \\nwho move around a lot.\\xa0\\xa0 The Hadza people in Tanzania \\nwalk an average of\\xa09 km a day to find wild plants and hunt animals,\\xa0dig for tubers, climb trees for honey,\\xa0or collect water. They can move more in\\xa0a single day \\nthan an office worker in a week.\\xa0 So of course, they burn more calories, right? But it turns out that the Hadza burn the same\\xa0amount of calories per day as a typical person\\xa0in an industrialized country: around 1900 for\\xa0women and around 2600 for men – which doesn’t make\\xa0sense at all. It’s also not their genes, since\\xa0it’s the same for other hunter gatherer tribes. So the confused scientists looked at similar\\xa0measurements in individual countries. It got\\xa0even stranger: Active people who work out\\xa0regularly do burn more than inactive people.\\xa0\\xa0 But only very little, often as low as 100\\xa0calories, \\nthe equivalent of a single apple. For some strange reason in the long term, the\\xa0amount of calories you burn is often relatively\\xa0unrelated to your lifestyle. Per kilo of muscle\\xa0weight, your body has a relatively fixed calorie budget it wants to burn per day. Sure, if\\xa0you want to gain muscles by pumping iron,\\xa0 you also need to eat more to build and sustain\\xa0them or your new muscles wither away. But in total, your body keeps your calorie\\xa0budget per unit of you, pretty stable. And to make matters worse, if you want to lose\\xa0fat your body sabotages you in small and big ways: First of all, when you begin to work out\\xa0regularly, maybe going for a run in the morning,\\xa0 your body may subconsciously make you move\\xa0less when you don’t pay attention. Maybe you take the elevator instead of the stairs, you\\xa0sit more when you meet\\n your friends or you\\xa0sleep longer – largely balancing out your burn\\xa0again, preventing you from burning much fat. You can overcome this temporarily: If you do\\xa0actually change your life \\nafter sitting around\\xa0for years and suddenly start working out without\\xa0eating more, this is a shock to your system. You\\xa0actually do burn more calories and lose fat – so\\xa0you can lose weight through exercise! But this is\\xa0often very short-lived. Your body adapts and burns\\xa0fewer and fewer extra calories each week until it\\xa0restores its original calorie budget. After a few\\xa0months you burn a very similar amount \\nto what you\\xa0did when you didn’t work out. If you stay really\\xa0consistent your burn might increase slightly and\\xa0your body composition might change, but most\\xa0people struggle with keeping up the habit, if they don’t love the extra movement. Which\\xa0is why so many people hit a weight loss plateau Objection! What about muscles? Muscles burn 3\\xa0times more calories at rest than fat. This sounds\\xa0impressive, but tissues like your brain, skin\\xa0or intestines burn way more. In absolute terms,\\xa0 a more muscular body composition makes a\\xa0difference for how many calories your body\\xa0burns, but it’s relatively small.\\xa0 Muscles matter a lot for \\nhealth,\\xa0longevity and performance, but\\xa0not that much for weight loss. Bizarre. And now we are getting to the\\xa0actual reason why exercise is healthy. [Why Your Body Is Sabotaging You] So your body has an activity budget per\\xa0day that it wants to stick to. This setting evolved when humans had to move a lot. Not because they wanted to, \\nbut because they had to find food for survival. But when\\xa0food is abundant and exercise is voluntary, what does your body do with the energy\\xa0\\nthat you are not using to move around? We are simplifying a lot here and this is\\xa0relatively new science, but in a nutshell: There are many different systems in your\\xa0body trying to do their job as well as possible. And if there’s extra energy, they\\xa0seem to use it. Unfortunately this is bad. When your immune cells detect injuries\\xa0or infections, they trigger inflammation. Fighter cells, alarm chemicals \\nand fluids flood\\xa0into your tissue. This is crucial but it also causes damage, so it needs to be cleaned\\xa0up quickly \\nor it can become chronic. And chronic inflammation is one of the major\\xa0contributors to many serious diseases, from cancer to heart failure. If your\\xa0immune system is on a tight budget, it has to be efficient with inflammation – with\\xa0lots of free calories though, it over commits. Another thing is that your glands produce\\xa0hormones you don’t need. Like cortisol, the stress hormone,\\n which triggers your fight\\xa0or flight response. Crucial for survival, \\nbut if you have too much of it you get, well,\\xa0very stressed, all the time. Chronic stress is a major cause for a bouquet of health issues\\xa0including your mental state. For our ancestors who moved a lot and had to deal with sudden\\xa0bursts of activity, fleeing from a lion, attacking that bison, this cortisol was crucial\\xa0– but if you live a modern, sedentary lifestyle your body is ready for action that doesn’t\\xa0happen, hurting itself in the process. Your body evolved to move regularly\\xa0and is fine tuned to a certain base level of activity. If this activity\\xa0is missing it still uses almost the identical amount of energy, just on\\xa0stupid stuff. This is why you burn a similar amount of calories whether you\\xa0work out or not. A lot of the energy you spend working out is energy you don’t spend on\\xa0other physical activities and body processes. Working out is not a magic bullet, but it seems\\xa0to restore an internal physical balance that seriously affects your body. And this is also\\xa0why regular \\nexercise is so incredibly healthy, the evidence is incredibly clear here. It\\xa0reduces chronic inflammation and stress, it is good for your heart, may ease depression, and makes you live longer and better. [Why Humans Are So Hungry] When your ancestors evolved, they had to work\\xa0hard for calories. Sometimes it would be easy and they could afford to chill out quite\\xa0a bit. But in hard times they had to move quite a bit to feed themselves, walk longer\\xa0to find prey, or dig longer to find tubers. If extra movement burned more calories this\\xa0would lead to a spiral of starvation. The less food you find, \\nthe more energy you need\\xa0to find food – which doesn’t even fill you up, \\nbecause you moved more. It’s like\\xa0taking on more debt when you are in the red. It works for a while, \\nbut then you\\xa0go bankrupt and die. So for your ancestors, being able to move a lot without burning\\xa0extra calories was a matter of life and death. Ok. But this means the \\nobesity epidemic of the\\xa0modern world is not primarily caused by laziness, but by overeating. Humans evolved\\xa0to be mad for calories. Because of our extremely hungry brains,\\xa0and our extremely useless kids. Kids are cute but unlike other species,\\xa0 human kids have to be fed \\nand cared for by adults for years before they become\\xa0even remotely useful. Because the human brain not only eats up about 20% of all\\xa0our calories at rest – twice as much as our closest ape relatives’ – it also takes\\xa0a lot of time to develop through playing, learning and honing social skills – \\xa0all the things that make us human. Our species is so extremely \\ncalorie-expensive\\xa0to maintain that we became super-efficient calorie harvesters. 5 hours of human hunter\\xa0gatherer foraging yields between 3,000 and 5,000 calories, while our ape relatives\\xa0get no more than 1,500 in the same time. And we became so good at calorie harvesting\\xa0precisely because of our big brains and years of social skill training. In a typical\\xa0ancestral tribe some members would spend the day searching for plants, others hunting\\xa0or gathering honey, \\nothers nurturing kids.\\xa0\\xa0 And at the end of the day, we’d share the\\xa0calories so that no one would end up hungry. Being frenetic calorie harvesters seems to\\xa0be deeply part of what makes us human. It's not a bug, but a feature. But today it\\xa0seems as if \\nthat feature has turned on us – we can’t stop overproducing food,\\xa0and overeating. If you want to lose fat, reducing calories is the biggest part of the\\xa0answer. We’ll cover diet in the next part. So to conclude: You will probably not lose\\xa0nearly as much fat by working out as you hoped, but you will do something more important:\\xa0 give your body balance and make you more resilient and prevent or delay many of\\xa0the \\ndiseases that will make your life miserable, so you can enjoy a higher\\xa0quality of life, for much longer.

Congratulations,\\xa0\\xa0 you’re a time traveler! A bit lame, but\\xa0\\nlet's start here to get to the fun,\\xa0\\xa0 real time travel to ride on\\xa0\\ndinosaurs and high five Einstein. Time isn’t really a thing\\xa0\\nthat passes but a dimension,\\xa0\\xa0 a direction you can move in. We think our\\xa0\\nuniverse is four dimensional, with three\\xa0\\xa0 spatial and one time dimensions - smooshed\\xa0\\ntogether into a fancy thing we call spacetime. What you experience as time passing and your\\xa0\\nlife happening, is actually you moving through\\xa0\\xa0 the time dimension. And this dimension is a\\xa0\\nbummer. While you can go forward-backward,\\xa0\\xa0 left and right, up and down in the space\\xa0\\ndimensions – in time you can only go:\\xa0\\xa0 Forward. You only get older, never\\xa0\\nyounger, you can’t make detours. But this is an illusion. You have far more\\xa0\\ncontrol over how you move through time. To\\xa0\\xa0 explain how this actually works without\\xa0\\nmaking a math video, we have to make a\\xa0\\xa0 lot of physicists grumpy, so please keep in\\xa0\\nmind that we are simplifying and lying a bit. Ok. So there is a very strange rule: Everything in\\xa0\\nour universe moves at the speed of light through\\xa0\\xa0 four dimensional spacetime. Your speed through\\xa0\\nspacetime is the sum of your separate speeds\\xa0\\xa0 through time and space. It's impossible for you\\xa0\\nto stay still. Even if you are not moving through\\xa0\\xa0 space dimensions, you are moving through the time\\xa0\\ndimension, blasting face first into the future. You can slow down in the time dimension, by moving\\xa0\\nfaster through the space dimensions but in total,\\xa0\\xa0 you will always move at the speed of light\\xa0\\nthrough spacetime. If you could somehow truly\\xa0\\xa0 stand still in space – you'd still move through time\\xa0\\nat the speed of light. And the other way around. Photons, light particles, move at the speed of\\xa0\\nlight through space. They don’t experience any\\xa0\\xa0 time passing because their speed in that time\\xa0\\ndimension is 0. In the time dimension they are\\xa0\\xa0 frozen in place. If you see light on earth,\\xa0\\nfrom the photon’s perspective it was just on\\xa0\\xa0 the surface of the sun and then suddenly crashed\\xa0\\ninto your eye with nothing happening in between. Remember we are telling a science story here, in\\xa0\\nreal life things are more complicated – for one,\\xa0\\xa0 it's impossible to truly stand still relative\\xa0\\nto space itself, you can only be standing still\\xa0\\xa0 relative to other things IN space. And you\\xa0\\ncan’t really define a reference frame for\\xa0\\xa0 photons as we just did. For details check\\xa0\\nout our sources, but now back to our story. Ok, so everything in the universe\\xa0\\nmoves at the same breathtaking speed,\\xa0\\xa0 but this speed is split between space and time.\\xa0\\xa0 Which leads to all sorts of wacky things\\xa0\\nand where we can see time travel happen. Real and Easy Time Travel When a bus drives past you it's moving a\\xa0\\nlittle bit faster through space than you\\xa0\\xa0 are. So it moves slower through time than you.\\xa0\\nOr how it is usually worded: The car is moving\\xa0\\xa0 slower through time relative to you. While this\\xa0\\nmakes things feel like weird physics magic,\\xa0\\xa0 it's very simple. Move faster through space,\\xa0\\ngo slower in time, move slower through space,\\xa0\\xa0 go faster in time. And if you add another\\xa0\\nperson moving way faster or slower than you,\\xa0\\xa0 both end up traveling different\\xa0\\ndistances in the time dimension. The story that is usually told to\\xa0\\ndemonstrate this, is to get twins,\\xa0\\xa0 force one of them into a rocket against their\\xa0\\nwill, shoot them through space super fast while\\xa0\\xa0 the other twin chills on Earth. And because\\xa0\\none twin moves very fast through space\\xa0\\xa0 while the other moves slowly on Earth, they\\xa0\\nmove at different speeds through time. When\\xa0\\xa0 the rocket finally gets home, they are\\xa0\\nno longer the same age and the younger\\xa0\\xa0 space twin is ready to start years of therapy\\xa0\\nfor being abducted by theoretical physicists. This is the twin paradox and it\\xa0\\nmakes perfect sense within the\\xa0\\xa0 rules of the universe. If you want to\\xa0\\nlearn more about the paradoxes of time,\\xa0\\xa0 we made a video about it. But in a nutshell you\\xa0\\nare using time dilation, the fact that your\\xa0\\xa0 position in time is subjective and only true\\xa0\\nfor yourself. With sufficiently fast rockets,\\xa0\\xa0 you could get as far as you want into the future.\\xa0\\nTechnically this way you could witness the end\\xa0\\xa0 of the universe or look at the final thing that\\xa0\\nwill ever happen! We also made videos about that! We should mention that there's\\xa0\\nanother way to jump forward in time. Massive objects bend space time, causing time\\xa0\\nto go slower near them. On Earth the effect is\\xa0\\xa0 tiny - the gravity of our planet makes time\\xa0\\npass 0.00000007% slower than in deep space,\\xa0\\xa0 far from any gravitational fields. Hardly\\xa0\\nuseful for time travel, but it’s a start. If you move into a really strong gravitational\\xa0\\nfield, like around a black hole, the closer\\xa0\\xa0 you get to the event horizon, the slower time\\xa0\\npasses for you. If we kidnap our twin again,\\xa0\\xa0 they won’t notice it at all - their watch\\xa0\\nticks as fast as it always does. But from\\xa0\\xa0 the outside they seem to almost stand still.\\xa0\\nOnly when the twin leaves the gravitational\\xa0\\xa0 field and comes back to earth do\\xa0\\nthey realize they time traveled. Ok, so you can time travel to the future by going\\xa0\\nfast or near a black hole. But this is pretty\\xa0\\xa0 lame and has literally only downsides except\\xa0\\nfor people who want to sort of teleport into\\xa0\\xa0 the future. And it makes building a gigantic\\xa0\\nhuman space empire super hard – because even\\xa0\\xa0 if we develop the technology to go really super\\xa0\\nfast between stars, going on a far away journey\\xa0\\xa0 will always mean leaving your home as you knew\\xa0\\nit forever. But now that we know all of this,\\xa0\\xa0 there is actually a way we could use the rules\\xa0\\nof our universe to travel BACKWARDS through time. The Past is a Far Away Land – Let’s go there So you always move through spacetime at\\xa0\\nthe speed of light. If you go fast through\\xa0\\xa0 the space dimension, you slow down in the\\xa0\\ntime dimension. And here we find an actual\\xa0\\xa0 opening for backwards time travel: The\\xa0\\ntheory of relativity, which may be the\\xa0\\xa0 most solid scientific theory we know, does NOT\\xa0\\nforbid faster than light motion through space. IF you move through the space dimension faster\\xa0\\nthan the speed of light – superluminal – you need\\xa0\\xa0 to move through the time dimension with negative\\xa0\\nspeed. That means you go BACKWARDS through time\\xa0\\xa0 relative to the rest of the universe – into the\\xa0\\npast. Actually, scientists have been looking for\\xa0\\xa0 superluminal particles and given them a name:\\xa0\\n“tachyons”. They could exist and would have\\xa0\\xa0 wild properties like getting faster when they lose\\xa0\\nenergy and of course, traveling backwards in time. Finally REAL time travel! Just like with photons, it isn't really possible\\xa0\\nto clearly define how time passes for tachyons\\xa0\\xa0 themselves – it depends on how you move through\\xa0\\nspacetime relative to them. But now for the first\\xa0\\xa0 time, some observers could actually see tachyons\\xa0\\nliterally traveling backwards in time. Which\\xa0\\xa0 means they could be used to directly interact\\xa0\\nwith the past. In theory you could use them\\xa0\\xa0 to send messages to your past self and change\\xa0\\nall sorts of things that have already happened. Maybe with some tachyon powered sci-fi future tech\\xa0\\nyou could see a star die before it was born. Meet\\xa0\\xa0 your great-grandparents. Prevent your past self\\xa0\\nfrom making that one dumb mistake, win the lottery\\xa0\\xa0 or get eaten by dinosaurs. And create juicy time\\xa0\\nparadoxes that also kind of break the universe... Oh, what's that? (Short Pause) Right. Sigh... It seems there are things in our universe that\\xa0\\nare impossible to mix. Unfortunately the theory\\xa0\\xa0 of relativity, specifically forbids anything that\\xa0\\nstarts out traveling slower than the speed of\\xa0\\xa0 light, to reach the speed of light. Because\\xa0\\nmoving faster through space requires energy\\xa0\\xa0 and the energy required to reach the speed\\xa0\\nof light is literally infinite. Even if you\\xa0\\xa0 could gather all the energy of the universe\\xa0\\nyou couldn’t accelerate a grain of sand to\\xa0\\xa0 the speed of light. You can get as close\\xa0\\nas you like but you can never reach it. It is possible to move at the speed of light,\\xa0\\nas photons do. But they ALWAYS move at the speed\\xa0\\xa0 of light. If you move superluminally, you will\\xa0\\nalways move superluminally. And sadly, so far,\\xa0\\xa0 we don’t have the tiniest bit of evidence\\xa0\\nthat tachyons exist. While they work on\\xa0\\xa0 paper, most scientists think they are not real. So for now it seems that time travel\\xa0\\ninto the past is strictly impossible,\\xa0\\xa0 no matter how hard we try. The past is a faraway\\xa0\\nland and while we can look at it in pictures\\xa0\\xa0 and movies and our memories, it's locked away.\\xa0\\nForever outside of our reach. While this is sad,\\xa0\\xa0 it leaves you with the most important time there\\xa0\\nis: Right now, the moment where you actually\\xa0\\xa0 exist – and a future that's yours to forge.\\xa0\\nIf you want you could even time travel to it.\\xa0 Luckily, shaping the future is much easier\\xa0\\nthan trying to change the past.

What exactly is it,\\xa0\\xa0how does it make your immune defense stronger\\xa0\\nand should you take a pill to combat it? The Heat of Life On earth life is able to thrive between\\xa0\\nthe extremes of -10°C in deep cool\\xa0\\xa0 pools and 120°C in thermal vents. Step outside\\xa0\\nthis range and die. Every animal or microbe\\xa0\\xa0 has a temperature range that is ideal and one\\xa0\\nthat is stressful but survivable for a while. Your ideal temperature is where your cells\\xa0\\nwork best, where their internal machinery\\xa0\\xa0 is the most efficient and the animal as\\xa0\\na whole the best adapted to its niche.\\xa0\\xa0 Humans are warm blooded animals and our bodies\\xa0\\nexpend a lot of energy to keep us around 37°C\\xa0\\xa0 or 98.6 °F. Which seems wasteful, but this\\xa0\\nmay actually be a defensive adaptation – our\\xa0\\xa0 temperature makes us almost entirely immune\\xa0\\nto one of the worst killers and parasites:\\xa0\\xa0 Fungi. Most colder animals and their insides\\xa0\\nare infected by them - but you are just too hot! Which brings us to fever. For any microbe that\\xa0\\nwants to infect you, your body is a world they\\xa0\\xa0 want to conquer. Fever is defensive climate change\\xa0\\npushing an invader outside its ideal temperature\\xa0\\xa0 range and making the world horrible. It evolved\\xa0\\nat least 600 million years ago and is widespread:\\xa0\\xa0 most animals increase their core\\xa0\\ntemperature when they are sick. Fish swim into warmer waters,\\xa0\\nlizards bathe in the sun. Bees\\xa0\\xa0 heat up the air inside their hive.\\nBut you, warm blooded mammal,\\xa0\\xa0 you have way more drastic options. Let's\\nmake you sick and see what happens. When Your Blood Turns Into Lava You're invaded by bacteria and viruses at\\xa0\\nthe same time. The invasion is powerful and\\xa0\\xa0 you need to slow it down as fast as possible.\\xa0\\nFever is part of your first line of defense,\\xa0\\xa0 triggered by a diverse group\\xa0\\nof chemicals called “pyrogens”,\\xa0\\xa0 “The creators of heat”. They float away from\\xa0\\nthe battlefield and pass right into your brain,\\xa0\\xa0 where specialized receptors pick them up\\xa0\\nand crank up your internal thermostat. First you begin to shiver. Your skeletal muscles\\xa0\\ncontract really quickly, which generates a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 heat in your core. At the same time usually the\\xa0\\nblood vessels near your surfaces contract and\\xa0\\xa0 prevent heat from escaping through your skin.\\xa0\\nYour skin cools down while your insides burn. Fever is a systemic, body wide response and\\xa0\\nis a serious energy investment for your body.\\xa0\\xa0 You burn about 10% more calories to stay\\xa0\\nalive for every degree centigrade your\\xa0\\xa0 body temperature rises. Fever is also\\xa0\\na strong order to lay down and rest,\\xa0\\xa0 to save energy and give your\\xa0\\nimmune system time to fight. Back to the battlefield: When the bacteria entered\\xa0\\nyour body they tried to be stealthy. But now they\\xa0\\xa0 have switched into high production mode. Their\\xa0\\ngoal is to multiply as fast as possible, which\\xa0\\xa0 means they need a lot of resources and are highly\\xa0\\nstressed. Imagine running a marathon while eating\\xa0\\xa0 a succulent chinese meal and giving birth. The\\xa0\\nlast thing bacteria need right now is more stress. So your immune system tries to stress them out\\xa0\\nas much as possible by ordering inflammation,\\xa0\\xa0 which floods the battlefield with fluids,\\xa0\\xa0 attack proteins and soldiers. Pretty\\xa0\\nstressful! Fever is even more stress! For the bacteria a moment ago the\\xa0\\ntemperature range was pleasant,\\xa0\\xa0 now the world burns! Heat can cause their\\xa0\\norgans to break and membranes to rupture,\\xa0\\xa0 damage their DNA and diminish protein production.\\xa0\\nThey are seriously suffering from the heat. Why doesn't this affect your cells? It does!\\xa0\\nAll of this is stressful for your cells too!\\xa0\\xa0 Virtually every system and organ of your\\xa0\\nbody works worse during fever – except one:\\xa0\\xa0 Your immune system. Neutrophils are recruited\\xa0\\nfaster, Macrophages and Dendritic Cells are\\xa0\\xa0 better at devouring enemies, Killer Cells\\xa0\\nkill better and so on. And fever animates\\xa0\\xa0 your immune cells to gobble up the critical\\xa0\\nresources your enemies need, like iron,\\xa0\\xa0 glucose and glutamine, turning the\\xa0\\nbattlefield into a food desert. The viruses that infected millions of cells are\\xa0\\xa0 doing even worse because they are also\\xa0\\nvery sensitive to heat. For example,\\xa0\\xa0 The rhinovirus that causes the common\\xa0\\ncold can only infect your respiratory\\xa0\\xa0 tract because it is significantly colder than\\xa0\\nthe rest of your body, even without fever.\\xa0 The heat is also really bad for the millions\\xa0\\nof cells that are infected by viruses\\xa0\\xa0 at this point. They are working super hard\\xa0\\nproducing viruses, which is pretty stressful. As the heat becomes too much to bear, the\\xa0\\nsuper stressed cells panic. As their internal\\xa0\\xa0 machinery is breaking and failing they quickly\\xa0\\nproduce billions of heat shock proteins,\\xa0\\xa0 or HSPs, that start repairs, keeping them alive. But this is a trap. Even your healthy cells produce HSPs to deal with\\xa0\\nthe heat – but if a cell makes too many of them,\\xa0\\xa0 this means it is more stressed than it\\xa0\\nshould be. And if it is too stressed,\\xa0\\xa0 something is wrong and it should be killed. So\\xa0\\nyour Natural Killer Cells and Killer T Cells are\\xa0\\xa0 activated and attracted by HSPs and start\\xa0\\nkilling infected cells and all the viruses\\xa0\\xa0 inside them. By trying to protect themselves,\\xa0\\ninfected cells are calling out to be destroyed. But if fever is such an effective weapon,\\xa0\\xa0 why don’t your enemies adapt to it? How is it\\xa0\\nstill viable, in so many different animals,\\xa0\\xa0 after hundreds of millions of years? A wild reason\\xa0\\nis that fever actually might outsmart evolution. If your enemies survive fever long\\xa0\\nenough, natural selection changes\\xa0\\xa0 them. The individuals that are better suited to\\xa0\\ndeal with heat reproduce more. After a few days,\\xa0\\xa0 they have adapted. But this becomes\\xa0\\na handicap – because the next step is\\xa0\\xa0 to infect new victims in new bodies, and\\xa0\\nnow healthy humans are too cold for them! Not impossible to infect, just harder. And\\xa0\\nthe heat resistant microbes now compete\\xa0\\xa0 with their cousins that like it colder\\xa0\\nand have an advantage infecting healthy\\xa0\\xa0 hosts. This creates an evolutionary\\xa0\\ndilemma without a perfect solution. To circumvent this, serious pathogens like\\xa0\\nmeasles use hit and run tactics. The measles virus\\xa0\\xa0 replicates ultra fast and is the most infectious\\xa0\\nright before your fever hits with full force.\\xa0\\xa0 It's brutally beaten back once your full immune\\xa0\\nresponse shows up. But by then the damage is done. Fever is an effective part of\\xa0\\nthe puzzle of your immune system,\\xa0\\xa0 helping to attack and stress your\\xa0\\nenemies from as many angles as\\xa0\\xa0 possible. But if fever is so great,\\xa0\\nwhy do we stop it when we are sick? Should you Fight Fever with Medications We think it is normal to have magic\\xa0\\npills, but relatively harmless,\\xa0\\xa0 over the counter pain medication like Aspirin or\\xa0\\nIbuprofen only became cheap and widely available\\xa0\\xa0 in the last century or so. Going to a pharmacy to\\xa0\\nget something for your headache is extremely new\\xa0\\xa0 in human history. Pain feels bad, so we've \\ngotten used to stopping it when we feel it. If you are sick, you're supposed to feel\\xa0a reasonable \\namount of pain so\\xa0you lie down and save energy.\\xa0\\xa0 This is not a bug but a feature of your immune\\xa0\\nsystem. But pain and fever are closely connected\\xa0\\xa0 and over the counter pain medication like\\xa0\\nIbuprofen and Paracetamol also work against fever. Especially in children fever is often suppressed\\xa0\\nby worried parents or doctors – sometimes because\\xa0\\xa0 they think fever itself is the disease or they\\xa0\\nare worried that it can do long term harm.  In general it's fair to say that for temperatures\\xa0\\nbelow 40°C or 104 °F, fever is not dangerous\\xa0\\xa0 and doesn’t need to be treated.\\nOf course there are also patients\\xa0\\xa0 that should not have fever – like pregnant\\xa0\\nwomen, seniors and seriously weakened\\xa0\\xa0 patients. For them the extra stress may be\\xa0\\ndangerous. Fever over 40°C is dangerous to\\xa0\\xa0 anybody because it's most likely caused\\xa0\\nby your internal heat monitor failing. Things get more complicated\\nin serious\\xa0disease territory. We also have evidence\\xa0that for \\nsome diseases like influenza or chickenpox antifever drugs \\ndo not help you to\\xa0heal faster. But we are also running \\n into ethics problems\\xa0here that make clinical trials difficult. In one\\xa0\\nstudy doctors gave strong anti fever treatment to\\xa0\\xa0 critical care patients – but had to stop\\xa0\\nafter mortality shot up. Overall we have\\xa0\\xa0 strong indications that more people may survive\\xa0\\nserious infectious diseases better with a fever. And there is very little clinical\\xa0\\nevidence that stopping fever leads to better health outcomes. But \\nthere are important exceptions, like neurological injuries and stroke.\\nWe definitely need a lot more research. So should you fight fever? Well, speak to\\xa0\\nyour doctor and don’t listen to internet\\xa0\\xa0 videos. But this decision is really about\\xa0\\npayoffs. If a fever is not dangerously\\xa0\\xa0 high and you can bear it, you are supporting\\xa0\\nyour defenses and may even get healthy a bit\\xa0\\xa0 faster. But if you feel really bad \\nand are healthy\\xa0in general,  taking a pill against pain and\\xa0fever \\nwill make you feel better quicker,\\xa0\\xa0 at the cost of a slightly\\xa0\\nless effective immune defense. However you decide, the next time\\xa0\\nyou are burning up and feeling bad,\\xa0\\xa0 you can rest easy in the knowledge that your\\xa0\\nenemies are having a much worse time than you.\\xa0 It’s thanks to doctors and researchers\\xa0\\nthat we have these insights – we’re just\\xa0\\xa0 doing our part by bringing them to\\xa0\\nyou.

Today I am moving over\\xa0\\nas the voice of kurzgesagt for something\\xa0\\xa0 really special. Our dearest friend John\\xa0Green\\nwould like to tell you a story that's\\xa0very close to his heart. So, let's hear it\\nfrom him directly. Hey, John! Hey, Steve. Thanks so much! Lets dive right in: The white death has haunted humanity like\\xa0\\nno other disease following us for thousands,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe millions of years. It\\xa0\\nwas there when we tamed fire,\\xa0\\xa0 invented culture, and ventured out of Africa\\xa0\\nto conquer the world. In 1815 it caused one\\xa0\\xa0 in four deaths in Britain. In the last\\xa0\\n200 years it killed a billion people,\\xa0\\xa0 way more than all wars and natural disasters\\xa0\\ncombined. Even today it’s the infectious disease\\xa0\\xa0 with the highest kill count. But… Do you even\\xa0\\nknow what we are talking about? We’re talking\\xa0\\xa0 about Mycobacterium tuberculosis, which causes\\xa0\\ntuberculosis or TB – our original arch enemy. Right now one in four humans alive are infected\\xa0\\nwith the bacterium – you may be one of them. So\\xa0\\xa0 how is it possible that\\nwe never hear\\xa0about TB? Well, the White Death is the\\xa0perfect human\\npredator: Very infectious but very quiet\\xa0\\xa0 most of the time, careful not to murder\\xa0\\nrecklessly. Perfectly adapted to your immune\\xa0\\xa0 system and just physically incredibly hard\\xa0\\nto kill. What exactly makes it so powerful? The Perfect Human Predator Usually the bacterium enters your body through\\xa0\\nthe airways and sets up home in the lungs,\\xa0\\xa0 a giant living cave system, defended by billions\\xa0\\nof macrophages, powerful guard cells that hunt\\xa0\\xa0 and kill intruders. The TB bug is quickly\\xa0\\nattacked and devoured alive. Unfortunately\\xa0\\xa0 this is its plan. The white death is the worst\\xa0\\nkind of parasite – an immune system parasite. Macrophages grab their victims,\\xa0\\ntrap them inside a phagosome and\\xa0\\xa0 flood it with acid that rips them to pieces.\\nBut TB evolved a thick, waxy coat that makes\\xa0\\xa0 it completely immune to those acids. Worse,\\xa0\\nit captures and modifies the macrophage to\\xa0\\xa0 be a perfect host. Like a tiny vampire, the\\xa0\\nparasite slowly consumes the cell. TB then\\xa0\\xa0 replicates extremely slowly. Other microbes that\\xa0\\nmake you sick multiply up to 60 times faster,\\xa0\\xa0 exploding their numbers before the immune\\xa0\\nsystem can eradicate them. But the white death\\xa0\\xa0 is so well adapted to you, it has already\\xa0\\nwon by being here. No need to rush things. When its host cell is sucked dry and dies,\\xa0\\xa0 the bacteria infect new macrophages.\\xa0\\nAlthough these bacteria are stealthy,\\xa0\\xa0 the decaying corpses they leave behind do\\xa0\\nactivate a proper immune response – your\\xa0\\xa0 body knows something is up and mobilizes its\\xa0\\nforces. But once again, this is part of the plan. Macrophages and many other immune cells\\ntry to\\xa0kill the bacteria, but that thick\\xa0\\xa0 cell wall makes them a formidable fortress and\\xa0\\nresistant to many attacks. And it infects its\\xa0\\xa0 attackers in the process. So when your cells\\xa0\\ncan’t kill them they do the next best thing:\\xa0\\xa0 keep the parasites from escaping. A granuloma is\\xa0\\nformed, a sort of white blob. In the center is a\\xa0\\xa0 core of infected and dead macrophages – a pleasant\\xa0\\nhome and food for the bacterium. Other immune\\xa0\\xa0 cells surround this sphere of death to contain it\\xa0\\n– creating a safespace where TB can sit for years.\\xa0\\xa0 Worse, it is perfectly protected from medication\\xa0\\nand releases chemicals that make it hard for your\\xa0\\xa0 heavy immune weapons to be activated. This\\xa0\\nis the stalemate version of Tuberculosis.\\xa0\\xa0 The infection is sleeping and the bacteria is\\xa0\\ndoing its thing. This is going on right now in\\xa0\\xa0 up to two billion people! But in one\\xa0in ten\\nof them, the disease will become active. Active Tuberculosis is an emergency. But again, a\\xa0\\nslow one. If your immune system can’t contain the\\xa0\\xa0 infection anymore, granulomas burst. Suddenly\\xa0\\nyour lungs are filled with macrophage corpses\\xa0\\xa0 and fresh bacteria. Your immune system panics\\xa0\\nand overreacts. Hordes of soldiers leave your\\xa0\\xa0 blood and rush to the infected areas. They\\xa0\\norder inflammation and fluids flood into\\xa0\\xa0 your lungs. But unfortunately, your lungs are\\xa0\\nnot made to be a battlefield. In their panic,\\xa0\\xa0 your immune cells don’t care – they’re\\xa0\\nrunning around with flamethrowers,\\xa0\\xa0 trying to purge the infection\\xa0\\nbut causing terrible damage. As fluids and dead tissue amass, it becomes\\xa0\\ndifficult to breathe and you begin coughing hard,\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes even coughing up blood. And\\xa0\\nagain this is part of the plan because\\xa0\\xa0 now you spread millions of bacteria\\xa0\\ncatching rides in tiny droplets.\\xa0 You burn a high fever and lose weight\\xa0\\nas your body is severely stressed. You\\xa0\\xa0 turn into a ghost version of yourself.\\xa0\\nEven if you are treated, this phase can\\xa0\\xa0 last weeks to months and is very serious.\\xa0\\nInsufficiently treated, TB will over months,\\xa0\\xa0 years, or even decades slowly overtake your body.\\xa0\\nEspecially for children or those already weakened,\\xa0\\xa0 this can be too much and the disease wins the\\xa0\\nwar. The bacterium spreads to other organs,\\xa0\\xa0 lung function breaks down and the patient dies.\\xa0\\n1.3 million people died this way in 2023 alone. The Worst Kind of Problem Tuberculosis is the worst kind of\\xa0\\nproblem: A slow one. Instead of killing\\xa0\\xa0 millions quickly like Covid, scaring a\\xa0\\npanicked humanity into frantic action,\\xa0\\xa0 TB is a smoldering fire. Killing too\\xa0\\nslowly for our short attention span. The symptoms are often mild for many months, so\\xa0\\nyou don’t feel in danger. Tuberculosis doesn’t\\xa0\\xa0 want to kill you of course, it wants to\\nstay alive and spread. And to do this,\\xa0\\xa0 it exploits human behavior: The people you are\\xa0\\nmost likely to infect are your family and friends,\\xa0\\xa0 coworkers or neighbors, the people you spend a lot\\xa0\\nof time with. When Covid brought the world to a\\xa0\\xa0 halt, the average patient infected 2-3 people. An\\xa0\\nactive TB patient infects 5 -15 people in a year. Most people catch it via breathing\\nin tiny droplets from a cough or\\xa0\\xa0 sneeze. This is especially common in crowded,\\xa0\\xa0 poorly ventilated housing or workplaces.\\xa0\\nWhich is why TB exploded during the\\xa0\\xa0 Industrial Revolution. And indeed wherever we\\xa0\\nsee new unplanned and overcrowded urbanization,\\xa0\\xa0 from Lagos to St. Petersburg, we tend to\\xa0\\nsee a rise of the White Death alongside it. Today most cases of active Tuberculosis\\xa0\\n– the version that spreads the disease\\xa0\\xa0 further – can be cured with a four-month\\xa0\\nregimen of four different antibiotics. But\\xa0\\xa0 if that’s the case… How is this still\\xa0the\\ndeadliest infectious disease on earth? Between 1940 and 1965, humans developed several\\xa0\\ndrugs to fight TB, finally making it curable.\\xa0\\xa0 It was a true achievement of human ingenuity.\\xa0\\nBut we didn’t do a great job of distributing\\xa0\\xa0 the cure. While Tuberculosis is almost extinct\\xa0\\nin much of Europe, the US and the Middle East,\\xa0\\xa0 it is still a very real threat in most of the\\xa0\\nworld. TB kills people primarily in Africa,\\xa0\\xa0 South America and Asia. In 2022 two thirds\\xa0\\nof all TB cases were in just six countries:\\xa0\\xa0 India, China, Indonesia, the Philippines,\\xa0\\nPakistan and Nigeria. Almost half of all\\xa0\\xa0 Tuberculosis deaths happened in South East Asia. But as it is a slow problem like climate change,\\xa0\\nit was ignored instead of fought aggressively,\\xa0\\xa0 which enabled more and more strains of\\xa0\\nTB to develop antibiotic resistance.\\xa0\\xa0 Which is a problem because we\\xa0\\nkinda stopped making new drugs. In the first twentyfive years of the\\xa0\\nantibiotic era, we developed eight\\xa0\\xa0 different classes of drugs to treat TB. And\\xa0\\nthen, in the 47 years between 1965 and 2012,\\xa0\\xa0 we developed none. Developing new drugs\\xa0\\nis extremely expensive and there was no\\xa0\\xa0 concentrated effort to eradicate TB,\\xa0\\nand there simply wasn’t enough profit\\xa0\\xa0 incentive. There is a vaccine, but it’s over\\xa0\\n100 years old and not particularly effective. But beginning in 2012, we did finally develop\\xa0\\ntwo new classes of drugs that treat TB,\\xa0\\xa0 and we may finally be at an inflection\\xa0\\npoint again, as better vaccines are on the\\xa0\\xa0 horizon. Companies that made Covid tests\\nalso\\xa0developed a quick test for TB. So,\\xa0\\xa0 we now have a real opportunity to push\\xa0\\nthis disease back until it dies forever. But only if we get enough people to know about\\xa0\\nTB – like you do now – and to care about it. A\\xa0\\xa0 century ago in the United States, there were\\xa0\\nalmost as many hospital beds for TB patients\\xa0\\xa0 as for treating all other illnesses and injuries\\xa0\\ncombined. The White Death was a leading cause of\\xa0\\xa0 death in the US and then one day it just\\xa0\\nwasn’t anymore. And we can do this again. 4,000 people died of tuberculosis yesterday,\\xa0\\nand we simply don’t have to accept a world\\xa0\\xa0 where so many of us still die of a disease\\xa0\\nwe know how to cure. The White Death has\\xa0\\xa0 been with us for millions of years. It is\\xa0\\ntime to continue our journey without it.

Free to choose what you do\\xa0\\nand make decisions? Or are you an NPC,\\xa0\\xa0 unable to decide anything for yourself? You\\xa0\\nfeel that you have control over your life,\\xa0\\xa0 or at least what you’ll have for breakfast.\\xa0\\nBut this may be an illusion. Physics actually\\xa0\\xa0 may force you to go through life as\\xa0\\nif on rails, with no free will at all. You experience free will all the time. Like when\\xa0\\xa0 you decided to watch this video\\xa0\\ninstead of doing something useful.\\xa0\\xa0 Free will is your ability to decide by yourself\\xa0\\nwhat you do. It means that the future is an open\\xa0\\xa0 arena that you can shape with your actions. It’s\\xa0\\nat the core of human relationships – it means\\xa0\\xa0 you are responsible for your actions, which\\xa0\\nis the basis of our moral and legal systems. There are too many dimensions for one short\\xa0\\nvideo – moral, psychological, biological,\\xa0\\xa0 so we’ll focus on the most essential\\xa0\\npart: Is free will even possible? Two main philosophical camps are fighting\\xa0\\nabout this. No matter how we represent them,\\xa0\\xa0 they'll be upset about it – so we’ll use\\xa0\\nour own words. The first camp claims that\\xa0\\xa0 the very idea of free will is fundamentally\\xa0\\nincompatible with the laws of the universe: You Are an NPC Whatever “you” exactly are, it's\\xa0\\nsomehow made up of your physical\\xa0\\xa0 brain and body. And these are made of cells,\\xa0\\xa0 which are made of proteins, which are made of\\xa0\\natoms and particles like protons or electrons. So fundamentally, you are a specific, quite\\xa0\\nlovely, dynamic pattern of particles. Particles\\xa0\\xa0 have no will, no motivation, no freedom,\\xa0\\nthey blindly follow the laws of physics.\\xa0\\xa0 And we don’t know why, but most laws\\xa0\\nof physics are deterministic – which\\xa0\\xa0 means that things happen the way they do\\xa0\\nbecause of the things that came before. If you play pool and hit a ball at a specific\\xa0\\nspeed and angle, the laws of physics tell you\\xa0\\xa0 exactly how all the balls on the table will\\xa0\\nbehave – their speeds, recoil directions,\\xa0\\xa0 everything. These laws completely decide the\\xa0\\nbehavior of all balls on the table. At the\\xa0\\xa0 microscopic level things work very much\\xa0\\nlike that, only without players. Actions\\xa0\\xa0 and reactions affect all the particles in the\\xa0\\nuniverse, creating a chain of causal effects\\xa0\\xa0 that extends throughout time, from the past to the\\xa0\\nfuture. Things happen, making other things happen. Now imagine that if, right after the\\xa0\\nBig Bang, a supersmart supercomputer\\xa0\\xa0 looked at every single particle in the\\xa0\\nuniverse and noted all their properties.\\xa0\\xa0 Just by applying the deterministic laws\\xa0\\nof physics, it should be able to predict\\xa0\\xa0 what all the particles in existence\\xa0\\nwould be doing until the end of time. But if you are made of particles and\\xa0\\nit’s technically possible to calculate\\xa0\\xa0 what particles will do forever, then\\xa0\\nyou never decided anything. Your past,\\xa0\\xa0 present and future were already\\xa0\\npredetermined and decided at the\\xa0\\xa0 Big Bang. That would mean there is a kind of\\xa0\\nfate and you are not free to decide anything. You may feel like you make decisions,\\xa0\\nbut you're actually on autopilot. The\\xa0\\xa0 motions of the particles that make\\xa0\\nup your brain cells that made you\\xa0\\xa0 watch this video were decided 14 billion\\xa0\\nyears ago. You are just in the room when\\xa0\\xa0 it happens. You're only witnessing how the\\xa0\\nuniverse inside you unfolds in real time. But this can’t be true because of quantum\\xa0\\nmechanics, right? Quantum processes are\\xa0\\xa0 intrinsically random, not deterministic, and\\xa0\\ncan’t be predicted with total certainty. On\\xa0\\xa0 the quantum pool table, balls can go\\xa0\\nrandomly left or up or banana. Their\\xa0\\xa0 behavior isn’t set by what came before\\xa0\\nbut randomly decided in real time. But for the no-free-will camp, this doesn’t\\xa0\\naffect their argument . They think that since\\xa0\\xa0 quantum processes are random, they don’t allow\\xa0\\nyou to make any decisions. Because if there is\\xa0\\xa0 randomness for the things that fundamentally\\xa0\\nmake up your brain and body, these random\\xa0\\xa0 processes make the decisions for you. How? Say an electron can randomly go right or\\xa0\\nleft. If it goes left, it triggers electric\\xa0\\xa0 currents between your neurons that create a\\xa0\\nneuronal process, which triggers a long chain\\xa0\\xa0 of actions that make you watch a youtube video.\\xa0\\nOr it goes right and makes you clean your room.\\xa0\\xa0 Just because the chain is extremely complex\\xa0\\ndoesn’t mean you have any control over it. So maybe your fate was not decided at the Big\\xa0\\nBang but it is decided at this very moment. The\\xa0\\xa0 important part is that it's not decided by you.\\xa0\\nYou get no say in this, you have no free will. Wow. This is kind of a bummer because the\\xa0\\nargument fundamentally seems to make sense.\\xa0\\xa0 Except nooooooo, screams the free will side, this\\xa0\\nis a really bad way to think about the universe. You Are The Main Character We know that we can reduce everything that\\xa0\\nexists to its basic particles and the laws that\\xa0\\xa0 guide them. While this makes physics feel like the\\xa0\\nonly scientific discipline that actually matters,\\xa0\\xa0 there is a problem: You can’t explain everything\\xa0\\nin our universe only in terms of particles. One key fact about reality that we can’t\\xa0\\nexplain by looking just at electrons and\\xa0\\xa0 quantum stuff is emergence. Emergence is\\xa0\\nwhen many small things together create\\xa0\\xa0 new fundamental traits that didn’t exist before. A drop of water is just a\\xa0\\nsextillion H2O molecules.\\xa0\\xa0 If you get water on your pants, they get\\xa0\\nwet. But what is… wetness? H2O molecules\\xa0\\xa0 are not wet. But your pants are definitely\\xa0\\nwet now. Many small things together just\\xa0\\xa0 created something new that doesn't exist\\xa0\\nat the level of the individual molecules. Emergence occurs at all levels of reality,\\xa0\\nand reality seems to be organized in layers:\\xa0\\xa0 atoms, molecules, cells, tissues, organs, you,\\xa0\\nsociety. Put many things in one layer together\\xa0\\xa0 and they’ll create the next layer up. Every\\xa0\\ntime they do, entirely new properties emerge. One Atom can’t handle information, but many\\xa0\\nof them together can form a DNA molecule.\\xa0\\xa0 Molecules are not alive, but many of them can form\\xa0\\na cell, and cells are alive. With each jump up the\\xa0\\xa0 complexity ladder the rules of what's possible\\xa0\\nchange. Completely new things emerge that are much\\xa0\\xa0 more than the sum of their parts. And here the\\xa0\\nreductionist view of the universe breaks down. The layers of reality need each other to make\\xa0\\nsense. You can explain living things with cells,\\xa0\\xa0 cells with molecules and molecules\\xa0\\nwith atoms. But because of emergence,\\xa0\\xa0 you can’t start with quantum particles and\\xa0\\nreconstruct the universe. You can’t explain\\xa0\\xa0 galaxies with quantum mechanics,\\xa0\\nor human psychology with quarks. This is not the whole story. Reality is not\\xa0\\njust structured in layers but for some reason\\xa0\\xa0 the layers are also largely independent of\\xa0\\neach other. Things existing within the same\\xa0\\xa0 layer can influence each other and maybe\\xa0\\na layer up or down. But often they don’t\\xa0\\xa0 seem to influence things much higher up or\\xa0\\ndown. To figure out how your organs work,\\xa0\\xa0 you don’t need quarks. To understand politics,\\xa0\\nyou don’t need to know about cells! If you want\\xa0\\xa0 to explain things happening on one layer, you\\xa0\\ncan only do that by staying close to that layer. “Noooooooo” screams the no-free-will camp\\xa0\\xa0 in frustration. “You can’t just\\xa0\\nuse magic to explain free will!” But the emergence argument doesn’t invoke\\xa0\\nmagic. It just says that thinking about free\\xa0\\xa0 will in terms of determinism and fundamental\\xa0\\nlaws is a dead end. A kind of category error,\\xa0\\xa0 like trying to explain galaxies by\\xa0\\nlooking at your digestive tract.\\xa0\\xa0 It is part of a reductionist school\\xa0\\nof thinking about the universe that\\xa0\\xa0 very successfully shaped science for a long\\xa0\\ntime – but that's challenged by emergence. So maybe, trying to understand free will\\xa0\\nby looking at fundamental particles,\\xa0\\xa0 deterministic laws and quantum\\xa0\\nmechanics misses the point. The\\xa0\\xa0 question we should be asking is – which\\xa0\\nlayer of reality is relevant to free will? Well, just like no individual molecule creates\\xa0\\nwetness, not a single cell in your brain wants\\xa0\\xa0 to watch Youtube. But one layer up, your\\xa0\\nbrain made of 80 billion interconnected\\xa0\\xa0 neurons does. On this layer all the things\\xa0\\nrelevant to you emerge: your consciousness,\\xa0\\xa0 character, feelings, your fears and dreams. This\\xa0\\nis where you emerge. We don’t know why and how,\\xa0\\xa0 but we know that you're here, right now.\\xa0\\nHow all the things going on in your brain\\xa0\\xa0 play off each other to make you who you are\\xa0\\nis a whole different can of worms – but on\\xa0\\xa0 this layer of reality, you are part of the\\xa0\\ndecision process. Because, at this level,\\xa0\\xa0 “you” are just one more physical cause of\\xa0\\nwhatever happens in your brain. You are shaped\\xa0\\xa0 by your decisions and your decisions are shaped by\\xa0\\nyou. You have a say about this layer of reality. You are not just witnessing how the\\xa0\\nuniverse inside you unfolds – you’re\\xa0\\xa0 actually taking part in it! And\\xa0\\nyou are free to do so however\\xa0\\xa0 you see fit. At least this is how\\xa0\\nsome on the free will side see it. Conclusion and Opinion So who is right? Is there free will? We\\xa0\\ndon’t know. If you ask us personally,\\xa0\\xa0 we think the argument for free will\\xa0\\nis more appealing because it brings\\xa0\\xa0 the complexity of the universe to the table.\\xa0\\nMaybe existence is just the sum of its parts,\\xa0\\xa0 but at least for now it seems\\xa0\\nthe universe is not that simple. But even if we don’t have free will, it’s\\xa0\\nnot clear what that changes for practical\\xa0\\xa0 purposes. You and us, we humans, on a purely\\xa0\\nsubjective basis, feel like we have free will\\xa0\\xa0 and that your decisions are yours to make. As\\xa0\\nlong as we are not sure either way, and if it\\xa0\\xa0 feels like you are making decisions, what does\\xa0\\nit matter if a non-existent supercomputer could\\xa0\\xa0 have calculated the future at the big bang?\\xa0\\nOr if quantum stuff all the way down randomly\\xa0\\xa0 nudges your cells one way or the other. Free\\xa0\\nwill that feels free is good enough for us. In any case, now you can decide what to do\\xa0\\nnext. Maybe get some stuff done? Or watch\\xa0\\xa0 more of our videos? It’s your decision! Probably. At least you can pick which \\nvideo to watch next -\\xa0\\xa0in theory. What you have really almost no control\\xa0\\nover is how the state of the world is presented to\\xa0\\xa0 you in the news.

But Ground News,\\xa0\\xa0 the sponsor of this video, can give you\\xa0\\nback a feeling of independence. They gather related news articles from around the\\xa0\\nworld in one place so you can compare coverage.\\xa0\\xa0 For example, last month the UK government\\xa0\\npassed a bill to deport asylum seekers to\\xa0\\xa0 Rwanda. This bill was widely covered by more\\xa0\\nthan 150 news sources around the world. And\\xa0\\xa0 using the Ground News Blindspot feed you can see\\xa0\\nhow this event is being framed by both sides of\\xa0\\xa0 the political spectrum - instead of one side\\xa0\\nthat an algorithm has decided you align with.\\xa0 Right leaning sources focused on the idea\\xa0\\nthat migrants are continuing to cross the\\xa0\\xa0 Channel despite the bill’s attempt to act as a\\xa0\\ndeterrent, while left-leaning sources focus on\\xa0\\xa0 human rights groups' opposition to the bill.\\nThis way you can compare different viewpoints\\xa0\\xa0 from all over the world, see how the story\\xa0\\nand coverage change and be better equipped\\xa0\\xa0 to engage in constructive dialogue\\xa0\\nwith those who hold different views.

You might be inside a black hole that's \\ninside a black hole that is inside\\xa0a black hole.  Everything in existence\\xa0could \\nbe black holes all the way down. It turns out black holes are much weirder than\\xa0\\nyou think and they break the universe much more\\xa0\\xa0 than is usually explained, destroying time and\\xa0\\nspace – and they may actually create infinite\\xa0\\xa0 universes in the process. But before we can \\nget to\\xa0that, let’s first build a black hole out of air. Everything can become a black hole if you\\xa0\\nsqueeze it to a critical limit. You'd\\xa0need to squeeze Earth down to the \\nsize of a coin\\xa0for it to turn into a black hole.  The Sun needs\\xa0\\xa0to be squeezed down to the \\nsize of a small\\xa0city to become a black hole.  And if a lot of\\xa0\\xa0mass is concentrated in a really \\ntiny\\xa0space, you get something super dense. This is usually how black holes are explained.\\xa0\\nStuff becomes super dense and collapses into\\xa0\\xa0 a black hole. But actually you don’t\\xa0\\nneed any ultra dense stuff to make them! We're ignoring some math here, but all\\xa0\\nyou really need to know is one thing:\\xa0\\xa0 The larger black holes get, the less dense they\\xa0\\nare. So really large black holes are kind of thin. A sun-mass black hole is only about 6 km wide\\xa0\\nand has a density of about one Himalayan range\\xa0\\xa0 per cubic meter. The supermassive black hole\\xa0\\nat the center of the Milky Way has a mass of 4\\xa0\\xa0 million suns, a diameter of 24 million kilometers,\\xa0\\nand a density of 6 blue whales per cubic meter.\\xa0\\xa0 The ultramassive black hole IRAS 20100−4156\\xa0\\nhas a mass of 3.8 billion suns and is as wide\\xa0\\xa0 as a solar system. But because it's\\xa0\\nso large, it is only as dense as air! This means, at least in theory, that if you take\\xa0\\na gigantic balloon and fill it with undecillions\\xa0\\xa0 of tons of air, the moment it gets to the size\\xa0\\nof a solar system, an event horizon suddenly\\xa0\\xa0 forms and it turns into a supermassive\\xa0\\nblack hole. Without violence or squeezing. So now let’s think big. What do we need to\\xa0\\nmake a black hole the size of the universe? A Universe-Sized Black Hole The chunk of the universe that we can see\\xa0\\nfrom Earth is a sphere with a radius of 45\\xa0\\xa0 billion light-years, filled with hundreds of\\xa0\\nbillions of galaxies, lots of gas and a bunch\\xa0\\xa0 of other things. If you add them up, it has the\\xa0\\nmass of about a million billion billion suns. Which sounds a lot – but on average, the\\xa0\\nuniverse is not very dense. If we break up all\\xa0\\xa0 the galaxies, stars, gas and energy, and spread\\xa0\\nthem equally inside the volume of the universe,\\xa0\\xa0 we get an average density of about 5\\xa0\\nhydrogen atoms per cubic meter. You\\xa0\\xa0 can imagine this as the sort of ultra thin\\xa0\\n“cosmic air” that makes up the universe. What would happen if we take a balloon as big as\\xa0\\xa0 the observable universe and\\xa0\\nfill it with “cosmic air”? Well, it turns out that all the mass in the\\xa0\\nobservable universe is more than enough to\\xa0\\xa0 create a black hole. Actually, it's\\xa0\\nenough to make a black hole 10 times\\xa0\\xa0 larger than the observable universe.\\xa0\\nBut that can only mean one thing – we\\xa0\\xa0 should be living deep inside a truly\\xa0\\ngargantuan, cosmic-sized black hole! There is one catch though. We know that our\\xa0\\nuniverse is expanding – and an expanding\\xa0\\xa0 universe is not what you'd expect to\\xa0\\nsee if you were inside a black hole. So\\xa0\\xa0 our universe can’t be a black hole – at least\\xa0\\nnot in the naive way we’ve just described.\\xa0\\xa0 Except there is a wild and mind-bending\\xa0\\ntrick the universe could play on us. To find out how, let's jump\\xa0\\ninto a black hole and die! A Whole Universe Born Inside a Black Hole We usually imagine black holes as spheres\\xa0\\nwith a singularity at their center,\\xa0\\xa0 a point where all their mass\\xa0\\nis concentrated so much that\\xa0\\xa0 our math breaks down. But this is\\xa0\\na lie – they are SO much weirder. From the outside a black hole looks like\\xa0\\na normal black sphere. But the inside is\\xa0\\xa0 where things stop making sense.  Black holes warp\\xa0the universe so \\nmuch that, at the event horizon,\\xa0\\xa0 space and time switch their roles. Inside a normal\\xa0\\nsphere, space is finite but time goes on forever.\\xa0\\xa0 But inside a black hole it's the other way around\\xa0\\n– space goes on forever but time is finite. So once inside, you see an infinite universe\\xa0\\nwith no center. The geometry is too complicated,\\xa0\\xa0 so we're simplifying. But basically\\xa0\\nyou could walk forever in one direction\\xa0\\xa0 or walk in another direction and\\xa0\\narrive at the same place again. But not only that. Inside a black hole time\\xa0\\nis finite, and it's now running out. So\\xa0after a while you start to notice that\\xa0\\nspace itself is slowly changing. In one\\xa0\\xa0 direction space is being stretched, while in\\xa0\\nall other directions space is shrinking – the\\xa0\\xa0 whole universe is being squeezed, kind\\xa0\\nof turning into a collapsing spaghetti. Sooner or later, the whole black hole\\xa0\\nuniverse collapses into itself. All of space,\\xa0\\xa0 every single part of it, is turning into a\\xa0\\nsingularity. So the singularity of a black\\xa0\\xa0 hole is not at its center or in any\\xa0\\ndirection at all. It's in the future\\xa0\\xa0 of whatever falls inside. We made a whole\\xa0\\nvideo about this if you want to learn more. So the singularity is not a place where you\\xa0\\ncan go – it's an event in time that happens.\\xa0\\xa0 Once it happens, you and everything else that\\xa0\\nfell inside the black hole will be mercilessly\\xa0\\xa0 crushed into an infinitely small region with\\xa0\\ninfinite gravity and infinite energy. Time,\\xa0\\xa0 space, none of it matters anymore, both kind of\\xa0\\nstop existing in ways that we would recognize. And then? Is this the end? Well, maybe not. This collapse of the black hole universe\\xa0\\ninto a singularity looks like one of the\\xa0\\xa0 scenarios for the end of our universe: The Big\\xa0\\nCrunch, where long after the Big Bang the whole\\xa0\\xa0 universe collapses into a singularity\\xa0again.  But if there is a Big Crunch,\\xa0\\nthere might be a Big Bounce – like a rubber ball\\xa0that you’ve \\nsqueezed too much and that suddenly\\xa0\\xa0 rebounds, space might expand again. So a new\\xa0\\nuniverse could be born inside a black hole. The funny thing about this\\xa0\\nscenario is that nothing has\\xa0\\xa0 changed in the slightest outside the\\xa0\\nblack hole. Watching from the outside,\\xa0\\xa0 it's still a black sphere of nothingness. And\\xa0\\nyet, on the inside a new universe has been born. So maybe our universe was born like\\xa0\\nthis and we are all actually inside\\xa0\\xa0 a black hole. But if our universe can also\\xa0\\ncreate black holes, they might give birth\\xa0\\xa0 to new universes. Is our black hole universe\\xa0\\nalso just part of a universe “further up”,\\xa0\\xa0 that's also a black hole inside another\\xa0\\nuniverse? Is there an end to it? Is there\\xa0\\xa0 one original universe? Is the cosmos black\\xa0\\nholes inside black holes inside black holes? Infinite Black Hole Universes If the universe creates black\\xa0\\nholes that create universes,\\xa0\\xa0 that then create new black holes that create\\xa0\\nnew universes, this cosmic self-reproduction\\xa0\\xa0 would be subject to natural selection.\\xa0\\nA Big Bang is a chaotic and messy event,\\xa0\\xa0 so it’s possible that the new daughter universes\\xa0\\nwould not always be fully identical to their mums.\\xa0\\xa0 Sometimes physics may be slightly different,\\xa0\\nwith some fundamental values higher or lower. And so some universes might be able to create\\xa0\\nloads of stars, planets and black holes. Others\\xa0\\xa0 might not, maybe creating a uniform cosmic soup\\xa0\\nwhere no stars, planets and black holes form. But if all universes are born inside black\\xa0\\nholes, in the long run all universe lines\\xa0\\xa0 that don’t create loads of black holes\\xa0\\nwould die out. The universes with the\\xa0\\xa0 conditions for loads of black holes would\\xa0\\nbecome the most common and spawn the most\\xa0\\xa0 daughter universes. Survival of the fittest,\\xa0\\nbut with universes instead of organisms. Our observable universe alone has created at\\xa0\\nleast 1017 black holes so far. So maybe our\\xa0\\xa0 universe has the physics and laws it has,\\xa0\\nbecause it was born after a long process\\xa0\\xa0 of cosmological selection that favored\\xa0\\nthe production of tons of black holes. And that would have a lovely side effect.\\xa0\\xa0 If universes are optimized to create as\\xa0\\nmany new black hole universes as possible,\\xa0\\xa0 they're optimized to create loads of galaxies\\xa0\\nand stars. And thereby also, by accident,\\xa0\\xa0 the conditions for life to emerge. So universes\\xa0\\nthat are the best at creating new universes are\\xa0\\xa0 also the best at creating life. If this scenario\\xa0\\nis true, who knows how many bazillions of black\\xa0\\xa0 hole universes might be out there. All with stars\\xa0\\nand planets, potentially home to others like us. So. Is our universe like this? The\\xa0\\ntruth is we don’t know. While these\\xa0\\xa0 ideas are based on real science and work on paper,\\xa0\\xa0 they're speculative and not testable. Also\\xa0\\ncyclic universes don’t actually explain why\\xa0\\xa0 the universe exists in the first place or why it\\xa0\\nis the way it is. Instead of providing answers,\\xa0\\xa0 these are really just new questions in disguise,\\xa0\\nso keep that in mind before getting too excited. But isn’t it just wonderful and\\xa0\\nheartwarming that we're living\\xa0\\xa0 in a universe where ideas as big as this\\xa0\\none are even thinkable? There might be so\\xa0\\xa0 much life. And if new universes are created\\xa0\\nconstantly, maybe life will go on forever.\\xa0 We’ve heard rumors of a chosen one.\\nA special birb who has the power to\\xa0\\xa0 illuminate the vast darkness of the universe,\\xa0\\nuncovering the great mysteries of the world.\\xa0 We are all born with this power.\\xa0\\nBut only few are able to master it.

Smoking creates a temporary problem\\xa0\\nand offers an instant solution. Once\\xa0\\xa0 your brain is used to nicotine,\\xa0\\nfor up to 72 hours you are itchy,\\xa0\\xa0 nervous and stressed – but one drag\\xa0\\nand instantly, you feel really good. But it's way more than just a physical addiction.\\xa0\\xa0 Smoking helps you focus at work and\\xa0\\nis an excuse to take regular breaks,\\xa0\\xa0 which is good for you mentally. It's a tool\\xa0\\nagainst boredom, it suppresses your appetite,\\xa0\\xa0 it makes bad moments feel less bad\\xa0\\nand good moments better. It's social,\\xa0\\xa0 fun together and a good way to make friends as\\xa0\\nsmokers always group up. Your lips are one of the\\xa0\\xa0 most sensitive parts of your body and putting\\xa0\\nsomething between them is deeply satisfying. So now that we've given smoking an honest\\xa0\\nintroduction, let's smoke a cigarette together\\xa0\\xa0 to see why it makes you feel so good and what\\xa0\\nexactly happens inside your body when you do it. The Best Worst Thing A cigarette is dried tobacco leaves mixed\\xa0\\nwith chemicals that make it burn slowly,\\xa0\\xa0 helping you to absorb nicotine, and flavours\\xa0\\nthat make the smoke less harsh. Let’s light it. Cigarette smoke is 95% gases like carbon dioxide\\xa0\\nand water vapour. The remaining 5% are particles\\xa0\\xa0 called tar and they contain the magic sauce:\\xa0\\ncarbon or nitrogen compounds filled with nicotine. As you inhale, billions of particles\\xa0\\ninteract with everything they pass through,\\xa0\\xa0 getting stuck on your throat, tongue and trachea.\\xa0\\nYour lungs are like big inflatable sponges and\\xa0\\xa0 have a filter and barrier; the cilia cells\\xa0\\nwith hair-like extensions covered by a layer\\xa0\\xa0 of mucus. They trap dust or bacteria to be\\xa0\\nswept away in a sort of dance. Tar particles\\xa0\\xa0 land in the mucus and turn into a sticky brown\\xa0\\nsubstance that stops the dance and paralyses\\xa0\\xa0 the cilia – allowing them to get deeper\\xa0\\ninto your lungs: to the alveoli. Alveoli are\\xa0\\xa0 little air sacs and here is where your actual\\xa0\\nbreathing happens. They have very thin walls,\\xa0\\xa0 so that the oxygen can transfer to your\\xa0\\nblood and carbon dioxide can leave. Now the magic is released. Nicotine passes through\\xa0\\nthe thin walls and enters your bloodstream,\\xa0\\xa0 reaching your brain so fast that it feels\\xa0\\ninstant. The positive effect arrives right away. If your brain had a control board, smoking\\xa0\\nwould be like pressing all the buttons at once,\\xa0\\xa0 releasing loads of transmitters and hormones\\xa0\\nthat affect your whole body. Epinephrine and\\xa0\\xa0 cortisol make your heart beat faster and your\\xa0\\nbody ready for action. Dopamine makes you feel\\xa0\\xa0 happy and relaxed and reduces your appetite.\\xa0\\nBeta-endorphins reduce pain and stress. Nicotine\\xa0\\xa0 excites and calmes you at the same time. You\\xa0\\nbecome more alert and able to focus. Your\\xa0\\xa0 nerves become more sensitive to pleasant\\xa0\\nsensations, then your whole body relaxes.\\xa0\\xa0 Together all of these effects just feel great. But your brain immediately tries to return\\xa0\\nto normal and pushes back against the effects\\xa0\\xa0 of nicotine. Which is fine as long as you have\\xa0\\nnicotine inside your blood. But once its effects\\xa0\\xa0 wear off, your body is left overcompensating,\\xa0\\ncreating a massive imbalance within itself. The more you smoke, the harder\\xa0\\nyour body tries to push back,\\xa0\\xa0 which is why nicotine is so addictive:\\xa0\\nYou stop feeling like yourself without it. It's still great, but now you\\xa0\\nalso need it just to feel normal. If that was all smoking did,\\xa0\\nwell that would be kind of ok. Nicotine comes with thousands of\\xa0\\ndifferent chemical buddies. Cadmium,\\xa0\\xa0 lead, arsenic and cyanide, hydrogen\\xa0\\nperoxide or nitrogen oxides cause\\xa0\\xa0 damage wherever they end up. Carbon monoxide\\xa0\\nreduces how much oxygen your blood can carry. In your lungs your cilia cells struggle. It's \\nhard to push mucus clogged up with tar\\xa0\\xa0 and some of your cilia cells die. Your alveoli\\xa0\\nare super sensitive and can’t handle this sort\\xa0\\xa0 of stress. A few of your tiny air sacs pop like\\xa0\\nballoons, causing irreparable damage. Your body\\xa0\\xa0 needs to get rid of all of this tar immediately!\\xa0\\nGoblet cells pump out extra mucus to compensate,\\xa0\\xa0 which makes breathing harder, so you start\\xa0\\ncoughing to get the tar and mucus out. Your immune system activates and macrophages begin\\xa0\\neating up tar particles. Smokers have way more of\\xa0\\xa0 these clean up cells here because their lungs are\\xa0\\nliterally full of dirt. But the nicotine makes the\\xa0\\xa0 macrophages sluggish and inefficient. Worse, they\\xa0\\nvomit chemicals that dissolve your lung tissue\\xa0\\xa0 and cause tiny wounds that turn into scar tissue.\\xa0\\nScars in your lungs are bad if you like breathing. Nicotine raises your heart rate while ordering\\xa0\\nblood vessels all over your body to constrict.\\xa0\\xa0 Meanwhile toxic chemicals get stuck, causing\\xa0\\ncountless tiny wounds all over your body\\xa0\\xa0 that will turn into scars. Those scars\\xa0\\nleak proteins that create random blood\\xa0\\xa0 clots making your blood vessels even narrower.\\xa0\\nConstricted and narrow vessels put a lot of\\xa0\\xa0 stress on your heart muscle that has to\\xa0\\nwork much harder to keep blood flowing. Inside your skin, the chemicals trigger\\xa0\\nenzymes that break down collagen,\\xa0\\xa0 the protein that makes your skin\\xa0\\nelastic and smooth. This creates\\xa0\\xa0 folds and wrinkles. Your skin ages\\xa0\\nmuch quicker and you look older sooner. But maybe the worst thing is what happens to your\\xa0\\nimmune system: All over your body it reacts to\\xa0\\xa0 tiny wounds and activates, fighting an invisible\\xa0\\nenemy, damaging healthy cells in the process.\\xa0\\xa0 While at the same time the nicotine makes it slow\\xa0\\nand sluggish. Worse at fighting actual diseases. We could go on like this, \\nbut this\\xa0is getting old. In a nutshell every\\xa0single one of \\nyour organs is highly stressed\\xa0 and suffers some kind \\nof permanent damage. Over time fats get stuck in the scars inside\\xa0\\nblood vessels, which get narrower and narrower,\\xa0\\xa0 until they start to suffocate your organs.\\xa0\\nYour overworked heart beats even harder to\\xa0\\xa0 push blood through the extra resistance and your\\xa0\\nblood pressure rises. So hard that fluids seep\\xa0\\xa0 out of blood vessels into your lungs, which\\xa0\\nmakes breathing even harder. The likelihood\\xa0\\xa0 of a blood clot blocking a critical\\xa0\\npassage in the body rises enormously,\\xa0\\xa0 which can eventually cause\\xa0\\na heart attack or a stroke. Almost all smokers eventually get Chronic\\xa0\\nObstructive Pulmonary Disease – so many of\\xa0\\xa0 your alveoli are irreversibly destroyed\\xa0\\nthat you are always short of breath,\\xa0\\xa0 never able to breathe freely. Once you have\\xa0\\nit, it can only get worse, never better again. Finally there is cancer. You get a sort\\xa0\\nof double whammy. On the one hand you\\xa0\\xa0 flood your whole system and especially your\\xa0\\nlungs with at least 70 highly cancer-causing\\xa0\\xa0 chemicals. And on the other hand you\\xa0\\nparalyse the part of your immune system\\xa0\\xa0 that kills and prevents cancer. This\\xa0\\nis why cancer is so likely in smokers. Ultimately, smoking is uniquely dangerous\\xa0\\namong the things you are legally allowed\\xa0to do. The average\\xa0smoker loses 10 years of life. Which \\nmeans\\xa0that some lose like 5 years and others more\\xa0\\xa0 like 25. You don’t know which one will\\xa0\\nbe you. But it cuts into your health\\xa0\\xa0 span even more – making a much larger part\\xa0\\nof your life spent being chronically sick. Ooooof So why don’t smokers not just like, stop doing it?\\xa0\\xa0 Smokers are often seen as unhinged or\\xa0\\nwithout discipline which is unfair. Nicotine is one of the most physically and\\xa0\\npsychologically addictive substances known\\xa0\\xa0 to humanity. If you ever start using it,\\xa0\\nyou'll likely struggle with it for the\\xa0\\xa0 rest of your life. The physical addiction\\xa0\\nlasts around 3 days – but the psychological\\xa0\\xa0 addiction is much harder to overcome,\\xa0\\nbecause you form strong habits and it's\\xa0\\xa0 connected to many social cues, like hanging\\xa0\\nout with friends or winding down from work. The perverse thing is that almost everybody who\\xa0\\nstarts smoking starts smoking as a teenager.\\xa0\\xa0 The tobacco industry has to target vulnerable\\xa0\\nbrains and get them hooked on the pleasurable\\xa0\\xa0 effects of nicotine or it would go away. Today\\xa0\\nabout a billion people will light a cigarette,\\xa0\\xa0 which is a lot but at least the trends are\\xa0\\nlooking good. In 2000 34% of adults were smoking,\\xa0\\xa0 in 2020 it was only 23%. Still, in 2023\\xa0\\nabout 8 million people died from it. But it’s not all doom and gloom. There are many\\xa0\\nsuccessful strategies for quitting, we’ve put\\xa0\\xa0 links to some in the video description. People\\xa0\\nwho stop smoking by the age of 35 on average don’t\\xa0\\xa0 die earlier than non-smokers. If you are older\\xa0\\nthan that, even quitting late can add years to\\xa0\\xa0 your life! It's a bit like with climate change –\\xa0every\\nbit counts even if damage has already been done. We're not the morality or health police.\\xa0\\nYou do you – but at least be aware what\\xa0\\xa0 exactly you are doing and why you are doing\\xa0\\nit – most of you watching this don’t smoke,\\xa0\\xa0 so, well, just maybe never try it. Smoking\\xa0\\nonly really solves a temporary problem – but\\xa0\\xa0 it creates loads of permanent ones. Good thing I never started – but it’s\\xa0\\xa0 not like I never do things I know\\xa0\\nI shouldn’t.

And if so, why is nobody visiting us? While the Milky Way is ancient and gigantic,\\xa0\\neven travelling at 10% the speed of light,\\xa0\\xa0 any civilization could take over the\\xa0\\nwhole galaxy within a million years.\\xa0\\xa0 But we haven’t seen anybody yet. So it\\xa0\\nseems we are alone in the Milky Way. But this idea is built on a lot of\\xa0\\nassumptions. Usually when scientists\\xa0\\xa0 speculate where all the alien civilizations\\xa0\\nare, they assume technology will progress\\xa0\\xa0 to a point where colonising all\\xa0\\nof space becomes kind of easy. But what if we are thinking about\\xa0\\nthis the wrong way? What if the\\xa0\\xa0 universe is full of life, but no matter\\xa0\\nhow technologically advanced you are,\\xa0\\xa0 space is never easy? What if\\xa0\\naliens slowly crawl through space,\\xa0\\xa0 expanding like humans did over the ocean? Let's\\xa0\\nlook at the only data point we have: ourselves. The Available Real Estate in the Galaxy Oceania is a region with tens of thousands of\\xa0\\nislands scattered across millions of square\\xa0\\xa0 kilometers, separated by an unforgiving,\\xa0\\ndeadly sea. Kind of like a galaxy. Some 5000 years ago the first people set\\xa0\\nout to colonise Oceania. Especially the\\xa0\\xa0 Polynesians achieved mind blowing feats.\\xa0\\nWithout any modern technology they set\\xa0\\xa0 out into the vast nothingness hoping to find a\\xa0\\nnew island to claim or like die far from home. But most of the pacific islands are merely a\\xa0\\nfew wet rocks or corrals, maybe some palm trees\\xa0\\xa0 and if you are lucky, birds making a pit stop.\\xa0\\nOthers with more vegetation are often hostile,\\xa0\\xa0 lacking the resources to really sustain a lot\\xa0\\nof people and remain uninhabited even today. And then there are the good islands. The Polyneisians colonised them, spreading\\xa0\\ntheir culture and society to dozens of remote\\xa0\\xa0 islands of all sizes. Some united in kingdoms\\xa0\\nspanning many islands, others were independent,\\xa0\\xa0 many home to competing and belligerent tribes. And\\xa0\\nalthough thousands of kilometers apart, even the\\xa0\\xa0 most remote islands were connected with at least\\xa0\\nsome trade and exchange. A microcosm of humanity. But it didn’t always work out. The\\xa0\\nextremely isolated Pitcairn islands\\xa0\\xa0 were settled for hundreds of years and relied\\xa0\\non trade with each other and bigger islands\\xa0\\xa0 hundreds of kilometers away. And then\\xa0\\nthe local population vanished. We don’t\\xa0\\xa0 know why – maybe because the islanders did the\\xa0\\nhuman thing and ravaged the natural resources\\xa0\\xa0 until they became unsustainable. Maybe the\\xa0\\ndecline on distant bigger islands severed\\xa0\\xa0 important connections. We only know their\\xa0\\nculture declined and they left or died out. What if space is an ocean to us? A\\xa0\\nhostile place that’s hard to conquer?\\xa0\\xa0 Would alien civilizations\\xa0\\nspread like the Polynesians? The Universe is kind of a horrible place The Milky Way has around 200 billion star systems\\xa0\\nand it seems that almost all of them have planets.\\xa0\\xa0 Estimates vary, but there may be some 300 million\\xa0\\nto tens of billions of rocky, earth-like planets,\\xa0\\xa0 in the habitable zone around a star, where water\\xa0\\ncan be liquid. Amazing! Except that most of them\\xa0\\xa0 are terrible. Hells of lava, dead frozen\\xa0\\nworlds, bare rocks sterile from radiation,\\xa0\\xa0 blanked by toxic atmospheres. It's easy to\\xa0\\nforget, but Venus and Mars are “earth-like”, too. Mars is the next human frontier and fairly\\xa0\\nexciting – but Mars dust is poison and deadly\\xa0\\xa0 radiation and low gravity will make you sick.\\xa0\\nMars is the worst. Except Venus is even worse,\\xa0\\xa0 crushing you to death, burning\\xa0\\nand dissolving you in acid. If humanity was really motivated and had the\\xa0\\nresources and energy, both could be terraformed\\xa0\\xa0 within maybe a thousand years – we showed how in\\xa0\\nother videos. But the thing is, we already have\\xa0\\xa0 a planet that's pretty great, so currently\\xa0\\nhumanity's motivation is not very strong. Now let's think about this in\\xa0\\nterms of galactic expansion. If the milky way is like a vast ocean full of\\xa0\\nislands, most are planets like Mars and Venus.,\\xa0\\xa0 Barren rocks or corals, where nothing\\xa0\\ngrows and the elements kill you. Imagine boarding a generation ship to travel for\\xa0\\n100 years or more, only to arrive at a new star\\xa0\\xa0 and then you get a… Mars. Or worse, a Venus.\\xa0\\nWhat a let down. Terraforming them is such\\xa0\\xa0 an intense investment in terms of resources to\\xa0\\nmake it worth spending the time to travel to the\\xa0\\xa0 stars for bad planets. Maybe the simple reason\\xa0\\nwe don’t see galaxy spanning civilizations is\\xa0\\xa0 that the economics just don’t add up for\\xa0\\nalmost all of the star systems out there. But wait, you might say: It's actually easy!\\xa0\\nA high tech race with unlimited resources\\xa0\\xa0 could automate this process, sending thinking\\xa0\\nmachines that report back every few thousand\\xa0\\xa0 years with new planets ready for fresh settlers,\\xa0\\nor automated ships with embryos. But if it were\\xa0\\xa0 that easy someone would have done it by now. So\\xa0\\neither we are really alone – or it's not easy. Thinking about alien civilizations you\\xa0\\nneed to make loads of assumptions – and\\xa0\\xa0 for this video we are assuming that space is hard,\\xa0\\xa0 even for high tech civilizations that have\\xa0\\nbroken free from the limitations we have today. Now things are getting exciting. So what if alien civilizations actually\\xa0\\nignore the bad islands and just pick\\xa0\\xa0 the very best? Stringing together\\xa0\\nisland empires like the Polynesians? Thousands of Galactic Empires Every star moves in its own orbit through\\xa0\\nthe galaxy and most stellar neighbourhoods\\xa0\\xa0 are only temporary. At any given time, in\\xa0\\nsome regions there will be more good islands\\xa0\\xa0 than in others. While simply because of bad\\xa0\\nluck, other regions will be pretty isolated. Earth might currently be in one of these\\xa0\\nbackwaters, surrounded by really bad\\xa0\\xa0 islands for dozens of light years in all\\xa0\\ndirections. We may be Pitcairn island,\\xa0\\xa0 so isolated that nobody knows we are here,\\xa0\\nor cares to establish a colony so remote. But elsewhere in the Milky Way good islands may\\xa0\\nbe more common! There it would be relatively\\xa0\\xa0 easy for a high tech civilization to jump from one\\xa0\\ngood star system to the next, creating connected\\xa0\\xa0 empires. Strings of worlds, with all the adventure\\xa0\\nand challenges of expansion even to really good\\xa0\\xa0 planets. Do they need to animate dead worlds with\\xa0\\noceans? How do they cope with alien microorganisms\\xa0\\xa0 or strange ecosystems? Do they need to burn it\\xa0\\nall down and create a mirror of their home world,\\xa0\\xa0 or do they adapt? How many centuries do\\xa0\\nthey need to make a planet truly their home? Empires expanding in regions full of good islands\\xa0\\nwould probably meet each other. Maybe they trade,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe they fight. Maybe they have coffee\\xa0\\nand chat about the meaning of it all. And just like some of the Polynesian islands,\\xa0\\nit is likely that many of these planets would\\xa0\\xa0 be abandoned or for the empires to\\xa0\\nbreak apart for a number of reasons: First of all, most great neighbourhoods\\xa0\\nwould dissolve over time and connected\\xa0\\xa0 islands would become remote. Then it just\\xa0\\nmay be the nature of civilization to become\\xa0\\xa0 unsustainable or self destructive – humanity\\xa0\\nis extremely young and we’ve already flirted\\xa0\\xa0 with extinction. There are numerous existential\\xa0\\nrisks, cultural, technological and environmental\\xa0\\xa0 that any civilization has to deal with. And\\xa0\\nsmaller colonies on new planets would likely\\xa0\\xa0 be less resilient than their homeworlds and\\xa0\\nin bigger danger of dying out. Whenever this\\xa0\\xa0 happens this would leave a good island free\\xa0\\nagain for others to rediscover and colonise. Also space is just a different ballpark.\\xa0\\nThe enormous distances between stars make\\xa0\\xa0 it hard to maintain a consistent civilization\\xa0\\n– just think about how many cultures we have\\xa0\\xa0 on Earth alone. Imagine if sending a message\\xa0\\nbetween continents took decades to arrive.\\xa0\\xa0 Would colonies care what the home world wants\\xa0\\nfrom them, if it can neither help nor really\\xa0\\xa0 enforce its will on them? This also would make\\xa0\\ninterstellar war, except the genocidal kind,\\xa0\\xa0 completely uneconomic. Would you go to war with\\xa0\\nsomeone because their great grandfather killed\\xa0\\xa0 yours? At these distances, it's not like anyone\\xa0\\ncould easily sneak up on each other anyway. And on a much more fundamental level, if\\xa0\\nisland empires don’t exchange relevant\\xa0\\xa0 amounts of genetic information – if there\\xa0\\nare no hook ups between worlds –, sooner\\xa0\\xa0 or later these populations will develop in\\xa0\\ndifferent directions and eventually become\\xa0\\xa0 different species. Making it less likely\\xa0\\nthat they’ll want to be under common rule. So the idea of enormously big, connected\\xa0\\nempires may just not be feasible if the\\xa0\\xa0 galaxy is an ocean where good islands are few\\xa0\\nand far between. But this also means that new\\xa0\\xa0 civilizations may pop up constantly, spread and\\xa0\\npartially or completely die out, even if just\\xa0\\xa0 by splitting into different factions. Islands\\xa0\\nmay be recolonized and abandoned over and over. What would this mean for us? We might think we are alone only because\\xa0\\nwe are on an isolated island right now.\\xa0\\xa0 But there could be thousands of worlds full of\\xa0\\ndiverse civilizations elsewhere, that we would\\xa0\\xa0 eventually drift closer to - does this make\\xa0\\nthe milky way more scary or less scary? Is it\\xa0\\xa0 a good thing that we'd have time to get our act\\xa0\\ntogether before we face anyone else? Or is it a\\xa0\\xa0 great tragedy that we might not have the chance to\\xa0\\nmeet our neighbours beyond for a long, long time? Well we don’t know, but it is something for you to\\xa0\\nponder tonight when you look up at the sky again.\\xa0\\xa0 Hopefully humanity is still at the beginning\\xa0\\nand we’re learning a tiny bit more about the\\xa0\\xa0 universe every day – one day, we might spot a good\\xa0\\nisland. And if we are lucky, many more close by. One huge problem we face as a species is that we\\xa0\\ncan’t agree on what's going on.

Someone killed\\xa0\\nthe dinosaurs and we have the murderer! Witnesses\\xa0\\xa0 say that an Everest-sized asteroid hit\\xa0\\nEarth, devastated the planet and caused\\xa0\\xa0 a mass extinction. A simple, fascinating\\xa0\\nand convincing explanation. Or… is it? In the last few years, new evidence has\\xa0\\nreinvigorated an older theory pointing\\xa0\\xa0 at a second suspect. A very slow and\\xa0\\nliquid asteroid, 1000 times bigger,\\xa0\\xa0 hitting earth on the opposite side of the planet.\\xa0\\nLike the true crime channel we are, let's look\\xa0\\xa0 at the new evidence and tell a different story\\xa0\\nthat could change everything we thought we knew… The Last Days of a Kingdom 66 million years ago, Earth was barely\\xa0\\nrecognizable. It was the last days of the\\xa0\\xa0 Cretaceous, one of the hottest periods\\xa0\\nin Earth’s history and much more humid.\\xa0\\xa0 Lush jungles and woodlands covered much\\xa0\\nof the planet. Even the polar regions\\xa0\\xa0 were home to forests of prehistoric\\xa0\\npines and ferns. Amazing ecosystems\\xa0\\xa0 that were robust enough to survive the many\\xa0\\nmonths of darkness during the polar night. Oversized animals were everywhere.\\xa0\\nPterosaurs filled the skies,\\xa0\\xa0 marine lizards and long necked monsters up to\\xa0\\n15 meters swam in the oceans. And on land,\\xa0\\xa0 basically everything larger than one meter\\xa0\\nwas a dinosaur – one of the most successful\\xa0\\xa0 animals ever to walk Earth, dominating\\xa0\\nthe world for more than 150 million years. And then they were murdered. All\\xa0\\nthese majestic creatures vanished\\xa0\\xa0 in a split-second of geological time. Why? Yes, it is true that at around that time a big\\xa0\\nasteroid hit Earth. But… was this actually what\\xa0\\xa0 killed the dinosaurs? Or did it arrive just in\\xa0\\ntime to get all the blame? Because according to\\xa0\\xa0 some recent science, just before the asteroid\\xa0\\nstruck, an ancient nightmare, older than even\\xa0\\xa0 the dinosaurs, decided to destroy the world.\\xa0\\nLet's look at how it might have done it. The Beast Slowly Awakens The ancient continents almost resembled\\xa0\\nthe world of today but not quite. India\\xa0\\xa0 was still a continent-sized tropical island\\xa0\\nfull of lush rainforests and exotic life,\\xa0\\xa0 on its way to smash into Asia. But this paradise\\xa0\\nalso hosted something else. The Deccan Traps - a volcanic region a thousand kilometers wide and\\xa0\\nabout to come to life in a dramatic fashion. The apocalypse began quietly and silently.\\xa0\\nAbout 800,000 years before the impact,\\xa0\\xa0 the Deccan Traps began to exhale about\\xa0\\n10 million tonnes of CO2 and sulfur\\xa0\\xa0 dioxide each year. Which in the grand\\xa0\\nscheme of things was not that much,\\xa0\\xa0 so for a long time no one noticed. The\\xa0\\nproblem was, these emissions wouldn’t\\xa0\\xa0 stop. For half a million years, they started\\xa0\\nto dangerously pile up in the atmosphere. About 300,000 years before the asteroid, the\\xa0\\nDeccan Traps started to vomit lava. This was\\xa0\\xa0 nothing like a normal eruption – it was\\xa0\\na lava flood. Imagine a landscape with\\xa0\\xa0 volcanos stretching beyond the horizon. They were\\xa0\\nconstantly active, releasing a steady flow of\\xa0\\xa0 massive amounts of poison and lava, interrupted\\xa0\\nby much more violent and deadly eruptions. The lush paradise of India was the first victim\\xa0\\nas gigantic clouds spread toxic fumes and poisoned\\xa0\\xa0 the coastal regions. Clouds of ash darkened the\\xa0\\nsky as rivers of magma started massive wildfires,\\xa0\\xa0 eradicating many local ecosystems and\\xa0\\npaving the continent with dead dinosaurs. Still, at this point it all looked like\\xa0\\na local catastrophe – one of many that\\xa0\\xa0 have hit our planet over its billions of\\xa0\\nyears of history. Had it stopped here,\\xa0\\xa0 there might still be dinosaurs today. But\\xa0\\nthe nightmare hadn’t even begun yet. The Beast Turns Furious The Deccan Traps would just not stop\\xa0\\nspewing lava. And so, after hundreds of\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of years of never ending volcanic\\xa0\\nemissions, the catastrophe became global. First the planet experienced a wave of heating,\\xa0\\xa0 with oceans getting at least 2ºC hotter\\xa0\\nin just 100,000 years. Which is bad,\\xa0\\xa0 but just about the timeframe that\\xa0\\nleaves ecosystems a chance to adapt. But then nature would pull a cruel\\xa0\\nprank. Some of the gasses of the Deccan\\xa0\\xa0 Traps heated the planet up, while others\\xa0\\ncooled it down. But the mix was uneven,\\xa0\\xa0 so after the initial warming,\\xa0\\na period of cooling followed,\\xa0\\xa0 massively stressing the ecosystems that barely\\xa0\\nmanaged to adapt to the hotter temperatures. At the same time, the sulfur in the\\xa0\\natmosphere came back down as acid rain,\\xa0\\xa0 while the CO2 was acidifying the oceans\\xa0\\nand killing the plankton – which was,\\xa0\\xa0 and still is today, the basis of the food web\\xa0\\nin the oceans. And if plankton disappears,\\xa0\\xa0 a massive extinction is all but guaranteed. But now the grand finale was about to\\xa0\\nbegin. About 50,000 years before impact,\\xa0\\xa0 the true apocalypse came. Like a cosmic\\xa0\\nhorror breaking out of its prison,\\xa0\\xa0 the Deccan Traps roared and screamed and\\xa0\\nbegan to spew out tens of trillions of\\xa0\\xa0 tons of magma and even more deadly gasses\\xa0\\nin an onslaught that lasted for several\\xa0\\xa0 thousand years. Rolling over ecosystems,\\xa0\\ndevastating everything they reached. For a time as long as all of human civilization,\\xa0\\nthis lava armageddon brought massive wildfires.\\xa0\\xa0 Earthquakes and tsunamis smashed and shook\\xa0\\nthe continent. So much heat was released from\\xa0\\xa0 the roaring hot interior of our planet that it\\xa0\\nmight have created hypercanes – cyclones tens\\xa0\\xa0 of kilometers wide, with winds reaching\\xa0\\nalmost 1000 km/h – 3 times more than the\\xa0\\xa0 deadliest hurricane ever recorded by humanity.\\xa0\\nThese storms were so massive and intense that\\xa0\\xa0 they could reach tens of kilometers into the\\xa0\\nstratosphere and rip holes into the ozone layer,\\xa0\\xa0 with devastating consequences for all\\xa0\\nlife, now without protection from the sun’s\\xa0\\xa0 radiation. And of course, where the hyper storms\\xa0\\noccurred, devastation and death would follow. And if all this wasn’t enough, out of the\\xa0\\nguts of the earth came colossal amounts of\\xa0\\xa0 venom. Giant clouds loaded with mercury and\\xa0\\nhydrochloric acid rolled over the planet,\\xa0\\xa0 delivering the final blow to the remnants\\xa0\\nof a once magnificent and fertile world. As\\xa0\\xa0 food chains crumbled and the whole world\\xa0\\naround them collapsed, some of the last\\xa0\\xa0 dinosaurs to ever walk the Earth may have died\\xa0\\nvomiting toxic foam while being bathed in acid\\xa0\\xa0 rain. A cruel end for the members of a noble\\xa0\\nfamily that had ruled the world for so long. Then, it just ended. The frenetic eruptions slowed\\xa0\\ndown and the endless natural disasters began to\\xa0\\xa0 fade away. But the world was changed forever.\\xa0\\nThe monster had left unfathomable devastation\\xa0\\xa0 and corpses in its wake. Even the planet’s\\xa0\\necosystems far away were severely wounded. It was\\xa0\\xa0 the end of a whole geological era. A murder that\\xa0\\nstarted slowly and then turned loud and violent. And then it happened. Like a cosmic joke, on the other side of the\\xa0\\nworld, a bright dot of light appeared in the sky.\\xa0\\xa0 And an instant later, an asteroid 10 km across\\xa0\\nsmashed into earth with the power of 4 billion\\xa0\\xa0 atomic bombs. If you want to see what this was\\xa0\\nlike, we made a whole video about it. If life on\\xa0\\xa0 earth was like a murder victim barely holding\\xa0\\non, this was the final blow. Just too much. After the massacre, on the\\xa0\\nother side of the world,\\xa0\\xa0 the Deccan Traps went on expelling tens\\xa0\\nof trillions of tons of deadly gasses\\xa0\\xa0 for another 800,000 years, making sure the\\xa0\\ndevastated planet stayed covered in poison. When they eventually finished\\xa0\\nand truly went back to sleep,\\xa0\\xa0 75% of all species on Earth had perished. Most\\xa0\\nfamously almost all dinosaurs. Except – birds,\\xa0\\xa0 the only dinos that are still with us today.\\xa0\\nTheir stunning beauty and diversity are a shy\\xa0\\xa0 reminder of how majestic and wonderful\\xa0\\ntheir larger cousins must have been. So - Who Was the Murderer? Were the dinosaurs doomed by the\\xa0\\ntraps? Or would they have survived\\xa0\\xa0 without the asteroid? Was it teamwork? Well,\\xa0\\nwe don’t know. Scientists have been fiercely\\xa0\\xa0 debating this question for years, but\\xa0\\nfor now we have no definite answer. The timeline of events that we’ve shown here is\\xa0\\nbased on some of the most recent reconstructions\\xa0\\xa0 of the evolution of the Deccan Traps. There are\\xa0\\nother ones that paint a different picture but\\xa0\\xa0 right now scientists are still fiercely arguing\\xa0\\nover this, check our sources to learn more. So like much of true crime, we can’t end this\\xa0\\nstory with an easy and satisfying resolution. Time has the nasty habit of erasing evidence,\\xa0\\nso maybe we’ll never really know. But there is\\xa0\\xa0 something else hidden in the dust, something\\xa0\\ntruly terrifying. As we learn more and more\\xa0\\xa0 about the past, we found that at least 4 of\\xa0\\nthe 5 big mass extinctions happened at the\\xa0\\xa0 same time as the Earth was furiously\\xa0\\nspewing gargantuan amounts of magma.\\xa0\\xa0 The monster that might have killed the\\xa0\\ndinosaurs seems to be a serial killer. The worst massacre ever, the Permian\\xa0\\nmass extinction 250 million years ago,\\xa0\\xa0 was caused by the Siberian Traps – a hellish\\xa0\\nflood of lava that killed 95% of all the\\xa0\\xa0 species on earth, almost bringing life to\\xa0\\nits knees. Until recently, many scientists\\xa0\\xa0 thought that this was an outlier, but new\\xa0\\nevidence suggests it may have been the rule. Other big mass extinctions happened when\\xa0\\nthe monster awoke from its sleep and the\\xa0\\xa0 longer and more violently it rampaged, the more\\xa0\\nslaughter we can see in the fossil record. So\\xa0\\xa0 maybe the dinosaurs were not massacred\\xa0\\nby a casual murderer from outer space,\\xa0\\xa0 but by a serial killer hiding beneath our feet. Do you need to worry about all of this? Definitely not. While the monster is real, it's\\xa0\\namazingly slow and currently very sleepy.  If it\\xa0were about to awake again, scientists monitoring\\xa0\\nthe Earth’s interior would get a warning really\\xa0\\xa0 early – maybe even millions of years in advance.\\xa0\\nTime enough to prepare and move out of the way. Enough about mysteries of the past\\xa0\\nand onto puzzles in the present! We are testing out this project crate from our\\xa0\\nsponsor KiwiCo today – they offer fun crates for\\xa0\\xa0 kids on topics like science, mechanics, biology\\xa0\\nand even things like ice-cream making and yes,\\xa0\\xa0 dinosaurs too.

Does it have an edge?\\xa0\\nAnd if so, what would you see if you went there? Today we know that the universe had a beginning\\xa0\\n14 billion years ago and that it's been\\xa0\\xa0 expanding ever since. But something that's\\xa0\\nexpanding should also have an edge, right? Well, it sort of does. Information can’t travel faster than light. That\\xa0\\nmeans that we can only see parts of the universe\\xa0\\xa0 whose light has had time to reach us in the\\xa0\\nlast 14 billion years. When we look outwards,\\xa0\\xa0 what we see is a sphere centered on us, the\\xa0\\nobservable universe. But it gets a tad more\\xa0\\xa0 complicated – because the universe has been\\xa0\\nexpanding, we know that the most far away\\xa0\\xa0 things whose light we can see are actually\\xa0\\n45 billion lightyears from us right now.\\xa0\\xa0 So the observable universe is a sphere\\xa0\\nwith a radius of 45 billion light years.\\xa0\\xa0 It contains around 200 billion galaxies,\\xa0\\neach with hundreds of billions of stars. So for us, there is an edge: We are looking\\xa0\\nat the past until there is just no past left.\\xa0\\xa0 This edge is really more like an edge\\xa0\\nin time and in a sense meaningless. The real universe is for sure bigger\\xa0\\nthan what we can see. But how much? There are two options – either the universe is\\xa0\\nreally big but finite, or it’s truly infinite. A finite universe means that, if\\xa0\\nyou want to fill it with ice cream,\\xa0\\xa0 you can do it. You need a lot of ice\\xa0\\ncream, but it is a finite amount. But that leads to a weird problem. Such a universe\\xa0\\nshould have an edge, a cosmic wall where space\\xa0\\xa0 ends. And if there is an edge there should be\\xa0\\nsomething outside that edge. But the universe by\\xa0\\xa0 definition is “all there is”, so how could there\\xa0\\nbe stuff outside all there is? Does the idea of\\xa0\\xa0 something outside of everything even make sense?\\xa0\\nExcept of course there is a physics hack: You can\\xa0\\xa0 have a universe that has no border, but that still\\xa0\\ncould be filled with a finite amount of ice cream. What if the universe is truly finite? Imagine an orange and a really tiny ant.\\xa0\\nThe ant can only see a small piece of the\\xa0\\xa0 skin – just as you can only see a small chunk\\xa0\\nof the universe. But if the ant starts walking,\\xa0\\xa0 it will eventually walk around the\\xa0\\nwhole orange and be back to its\\xa0\\xa0 starting point. So the skin of an orange is\\xa0\\nnot infinite – but it doesn’t have a border. The universe is not like the skin of an orange,\\xa0\\nbut it could be very similar – instead of a\\xa0\\xa0 sphere, it could be a hypersphere, where 3D-space\\xa0\\nis curled on itself. Which is impossible for your\\xa0\\xa0 brain to visualize unfortunately. But the\\xa0\\npoint is: no borders, no outside of the\\xa0\\xa0 hyper sphere – from our human ant perspective, our\\xa0\\nwhole 3D space is like the peel of the orange. If\\xa0\\xa0 you were aboard a spaceship flying in a straight\\xa0\\nline, you would eventually come back to Earth. How does any of this make sense? The actual\\xa0\\nphysics is hard, so we have to simplify and\\xa0\\xa0 lie a bit here. But in a nutshell it all boils\\xa0\\ndown to gravity: The way it works is that mass\\xa0\\xa0 creates gravity by bending spacetime. This\\xa0\\nbending is the strongest where the mass is,\\xa0\\xa0 but sort of stretches on forever, like a very\\xa0\\nmild tension in the fabric of spacetime itself.\\xa0\\xa0 This could bend the whole universe in\\xa0\\na way where it bends back on itself,\\xa0\\xa0 which then makes the hypersphere. If you\\xa0\\nfind this confusing, we are with you. If the universe happens to be a hypersphere, how\\xa0\\ncould we find out how big it is? On Earth we can\\xa0\\xa0 see things disappear below the horizon and\\xa0\\nthat helps us calculate how big the Earth is.\\xa0\\xa0 Scientists tried to find some sort of “universe\\xa0\\nhorizon” that would reveal the scale of the\\xa0\\xa0 cosmic sphere – but didn’t see anything. Which\\xa0\\nmeans that if the universe is a hypersphere,\\xa0\\xa0 it needs to be so big that from our perspective\\xa0\\nit looks like we are living on a flat surface. For\\xa0\\xa0 this to make sense, a hyperspherical universe\\xa0\\nshould be at least 1,000 times bigger than\\xa0\\xa0 our observable part. It could be a trillion times\\xa0\\nbigger for all we know, but not smaller than that. Some scientists thought all of this is way too\\xa0\\nstraight forward and came up with a wilder option:\\xa0\\xa0 The universe could be like the frosting of\\xa0\\na donut. A hyperdonut – also impossible to\\xa0\\xa0 visualize for your brain. This, too, means\\xa0\\nthat if you travel in a straight line,\\xa0\\xa0 you'd get back to where you\\xa0started.\\nBut with fun complications. In a hyperdonut universe there is\\xa0\\nnot the same amount of stuff in every\\xa0\\xa0 direction. If two spaceships\\xa0\\nfly in different directions,\\xa0\\xa0 one could get back to the start way earlier.\\xa0\\nThis also means that light from faraway\\xa0\\xa0 galaxies would do fun and confusing stuff,\\xa0\\nin a sort of cosmic hall-of-mirrors effect. We could see far away things in two places\\xa0\\n– but not just that, but we would see it in\\xa0\\xa0 different moments in time! Because its\\xa0\\nlight would have taken much longer to\\xa0\\xa0 travel in one direction than the other!\\xa0\\nYou could see a star being born in front\\xa0\\xa0 of you and see that same star die\\xa0\\non the opposite side of the sky. How big would such a hyper donut universe\\xa0\\nbe? Well, because of its strange geometry,\\xa0\\xa0 actually this is kind of the smallest possible\\xa0\\nuniverse – potentially just a few times bigger\\xa0\\xa0 than the observable universe. But it could\\xa0\\nalso be way, way bigger. We don’t know. Ok. So much for finite universes. But… What if\\xa0it's truly infinite and space goes\\xa0\\non forever? What would that be like? What if the universe is truly infinite? Actually, the cosmological model used by\\xa0\\nmost scientists, describes an infinite\\xa0\\xa0 universe. We mostly use it to calculate\\xa0\\nwhat happens inside our observable chunk,\\xa0\\xa0 but if taken literally, it\\xa0\\npredicts an infinite universe. An infinite universe goes on, well,\\xa0\\nforever, with no border anywhere – also\\xa0\\xa0 impossible to visualize. Wherever you\\xa0\\nlook you'll find more and more stuff\\xa0\\xa0 in every possible direction. This kind of\\xa0\\nbreaks our brain a bit for a few reasons: First of all, if the universe is infinite, is\\xa0\\nit also eternal and has been there forever?\\xa0\\xa0 Was there a time where there was nothing\\xa0\\neverywhere and then there was something\\xa0\\xa0 everywhere? Well we don’t know – but we\\xa0\\nhave a lot of evidence for the big bang,\\xa0\\xa0 so it really seems like the universe\\xa0\\nstarted at some point in the past. But wait – since the big bang the\\xa0\\nuniverse has been expanding. How can\\xa0\\xa0 an infinite thing that is everywhere\\xa0\\nbecome even bigger? Cosmic expansion\\xa0\\xa0 just means that the distance between\\xa0\\ngalaxies is growing with time. Even\\xa0\\xa0 an infinite space can become bigger.\\xa0\\nWelcome to the paradoxes of infinity. Infinity gets much weirder though. As you\\xa0\\ntravel with your spaceship in a straight line,\\xa0\\xa0 you find new galaxies, stars and planets, new\\xa0\\nwonders, new weird stuff, probably new aliens\\xa0\\xa0 and new lifeforms stranger than you could ever\\xa0\\nimagine. But after a long time, you might find the\\xa0\\xa0 most special thing in the universe: Yourself. An\\xa0\\nexact copy of you watching this video right now. How can that be? Well, everything in existence is\\xa0\\nmade of a finite amount of different particles.\\xa0\\xa0 And a finite number of different particles can\\xa0\\nonly be combined in a finite number of ways.\\xa0\\xa0 That number may be so large that it feels like\\xa0\\ninfinity to our brains – but it's not really. If you have finite options to build\\xa0\\nthings, but infinite space that is\\xa0\\xa0 full of things in all directions forever,\\xa0\\nthen it makes sense that by pure chance,\\xa0\\xa0 there will likely be repetition. Although\\xa0\\njust because something is possible,\\xa0\\xa0 doesn't mean it will actually happen. Maybe\\xa0\\nthe universe goes on forever but only the\\xa0\\xa0 boring stuff repeats itself endlessly.\\xa0\\nMaybe there is really only one you. But if the laws of physics are\\xa0\\nthe same everywhere, then far,\\xa0\\xa0 far away gas could have given\\xa0\\nbirth to stars and planets,\\xa0\\xa0 where primitive genetic information could\\xa0\\nemerge from chemistry. Which might have\\xa0\\xa0 ended up in cells and animals that evolved\\xa0\\nin really unlikely ways. And eventually\\xa0\\xa0 apes that learn how to create online videos. It\\xa0\\nhappened at least once, so the chance is not 0. Even if the chance of there being an exact\\xa0\\ncopy of you watching this video right now\\xa0\\xa0 is almost zero – almost zero is still\\xa0\\na huge number in an infinite universe. Unfortunately you'll never meet. Because almost\\xa0\\nzero still means the chance is incredibly small.\\xa0\\xa0 Earth as it exists right now is so unlikely,\\xa0\\nyou’d have to travel incredibly far to find a\\xa0\\xa0 second identical Earth: Some 10 to the 10\\xa0\\nto the 29 – a 1 followed by 100 octillion\\xa0\\xa0 zeros – times the size of the observable universe.\\xa0\\nSo far that it kind of means forever far away. Still, in a truly infinite universe, every\\xa0\\ncombination of particles could reasonably not just\\xa0\\xa0 (sighs) It's time to stop now. While these\\xa0\\nscenarios are possible on paper – we've\\xa0\\xa0 entered science philosophy here. Currently\\xa0\\nnone of these ideas are testable or proveable. If the universe is infinite we will never know. The reality is, for us the universe is finite\\xa0\\nand has an edge. And we can see the edge,\\xa0\\xa0 the edge in time. Everything we can interact\\xa0\\xa0 with is within the observable universe and\\xa0\\nmost likely, this will stay true forever. Even if this finite universe feels small to\\xa0\\nyou, it's more than big enough to fulfill all\\xa0\\xa0 the dreams that we and our descendants can ever\\xa0\\ncome up with. Infinitely enough for all of us.

Into anything that\\xa0\\xa0 happened before and the post-war apocalypse. In the worst case, mass fires consume everything\\xa0\\nwithin tens of thousands of square kilometers,\\xa0\\xa0 killing hundreds of millions within\\xa0\\nhours. But the worst part comes\\xa0\\xa0 after that - nuclear war could trigger a\\xa0\\nnuclear winter that might kill billions,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe even completely collapsing our civilization.\\xa0\\nHow does it work and what would it look like? Fire Causes Winter When a nuclear weapon is detonated, a bubble of\\xa0\\ngas hotter than the sun is forced into existence,\\xa0\\xa0 so hot that everything within kilometers\\xa0\\nimmediately begins to burn. The terror bubble\\xa0\\xa0 expands rapidly, filling the sky over its target,\\xa0\\ncreating a devastating shockwave that causes most\\xa0\\xa0 of the immediate destruction. Basically you\\xa0\\nbreak a lot of stuff and set it on fire – and\\xa0\\xa0 in the worst case this turns into a firestorm that\\xa0\\nconsumes everything and everyone on the ground. Right after the explosion a gigantic mushroom\\xa0\\ncloud rises over the destruction like a demon\\xa0\\xa0 throning over its perverse work, but in\\xa0\\nthe following hours a far more deadly\\xa0\\xa0 cloud forms. The fire burning cities,\\xa0\\nforests or fields, heats up so much air\\xa0\\xa0 that it creates its own micro climate and\\xa0\\nwind system. Hot air and hot smoke rise,\\xa0\\xa0 pulling in fresh air from the surroundings,\\xa0\\nand fresh oxygen stoking the flames even more.\\xa0\\xa0 This creates an updraft and forms\\xa0\\na colossal pyrocumulonimbus cloud\\xa0\\xa0 that carries the soot and aerosols from\\xa0\\nthe flames high into the stratosphere. Under normal conditions, the soot rising\\xa0\\nfrom a big fire is quickly washed out by rain.  But a pyrocumulonimbus cloud can\\xa0\\nreach altitudes well above the height\\xa0\\xa0 where rain clouds form. Once above the tropopause,\\xa0\\xa0 there is simply no weather to remove soot from\\xa0\\nthe atmosphere, so it can stay aloft for years. If this happens to a single city, it’s a tragedy,\\xa0\\nbut a fairly local one. But in a full scale\\xa0\\xa0 nuclear war, warring nations following the cold\\xa0\\nlogic of mutually assured destruction, could use\\xa0\\xa0 hundreds or even thousands of nuclear weapons all\\xa0\\nat once, creating hundreds of fire storms, sending\\xa0\\xa0 up to 150 million tons of soot, a cube the size\\xa0\\nof a skyscraper, directly into the stratosphere. In the next few days and weeks the soot\\xa0\\nbegins to blanket the earth at high altitudes,\\xa0\\xa0 absorbing light high above the ground\\xa0\\nand preventing sunlight from reaching\\xa0\\xa0 the surface . This is not like science fiction\\xa0\\nwhere the sky turns dark and the sun disappears.\\xa0\\xa0 Winter is what happens when just a little less\\xa0\\nsunlight hits the ground – and now suddenly a\\xa0\\xa0 lot less sunlight gets through. Yesterday the\\xa0\\nworld was normal. Today nuclear winter begins. Winter Causes Hunger How bad nuclear winter would be is still an active\\xa0\\narea of research. It all hinges on one thing:\\xa0\\xa0 How much stuff will burn really hot? How many\\xa0\\nfirestorms would be caused by the heat of the\\xa0\\xa0 explosions? This depends on many factors, from\\xa0\\nthe materials a city is made of, to the time of\\xa0\\xa0 the year, if a forest is nearby and so on. So just\\xa0\\nkeep in mind we are working with some assumptions. Here is the good news: Nuclear winter is\\xa0\\nnot permanent, and definitely no new ice\\xa0age.  The effects on the climate only last as\\xa0\\nlong as the soot remains in the atmosphere,\\xa0\\xa0 which is at most a decade or so until it\\xa0\\nclears out and temperatures normalize. The bad news is that this causes almost\\xa0\\nimmediate climate change within a few\\xa0\\xa0 weeks – it disrupts our climate system\\xa0\\nfaster than any living being can adapt to. In this new climate our seasons are suddenly\\xa0\\nall wrong. Winters are much longer, summers\\xa0\\xa0 shorter and colder – or gone altogether. This\\xa0\\nalso means less evaporation over the oceans,\\xa0\\xa0 which means less rain and maybe large scale\\xa0\\ndroughts. This is bad because our food eats the\\xa0sun.  Without good summers and enough rain,\\xa0\\ngrowing seasons shrink or even collapse. The majority of humanity lives in\\xa0\\nan area called the midlatitudes,\\xa0\\xa0 a strip of land that has the ideal temperature\\xa0\\nfor our species – not just because it's not\\xa0\\xa0 too hot or cold, it’s also where the plants\\xa0\\nwe eat grow best. The vast majority of the food\\xa0\\xa0 we eat stems from a few highly efficient\\xa0\\ncrops, that are mostly produced in a few\\xa0\\xa0 very agriculturally productive regions, like\\xa0\\nthe US Great Plains or Ukraine. From these\\xa0\\xa0 bread and rice baskets of the world, they\\xa0\\nget traded and shipped around the world. In the worst case of a full scale nuclear\\xa0\\nwar the temperatures in the midlatitudes\\xa0\\xa0 will probably stay below freezing for\\xa0\\nseveral years. Nothing at all can grow\\xa0\\xa0 under these conditions and the world's\\xa0\\nbreadbaskets would suddenly turn empty.\\xa0 If food production crashes, the world's food\\xa0\\nproducers would very likely ramp up prices or\\xa0\\xa0 even stop selling food to other countries – if\\xa0\\nthey're still able to farm their fields at all. It's easy to calculate how many people can be\\xa0\\nalive on earth – you take all the calories we\\xa0\\xa0 can produce and divide them by what the\\xa0\\naverage person needs to survive. If you\\xa0\\xa0 have more people than calories, then within a few\\xa0\\nweeks you don’t anymore. Humanity has only a few\\xa0\\xa0 weeks' supply of crops and food, not enough\\xa0\\nto survive this drastic drop in production. But the climate is not the only issue: modern\\xa0\\nindustrialized agriculture is a complex affair\\xa0\\xa0 that relies on functioning supply chains to\\xa0\\nprovide unthinkable amounts of industrially\\xa0\\xa0 produced fertilizer and chemicals to kill weeds\\xa0\\nand vermin. Massive numbers of specialized modern\\xa0\\xa0 machinery is plowing, sowing, harvesting\\xa0\\nand distributing. After a nuclear war,\\xa0\\xa0 especially if the countries that produce the\\xa0\\nfood were part of the nuclear exchange, there\\xa0\\xa0 may simply be no more fuel, fertilizer or machine\\xa0\\nparts, because there are no more oil refineries,\\xa0\\xa0 ports and other essential infrastructure left,\\xa0\\ndamaging global food production even more. Ok, so now that we set the stage, let’s look\\xa0\\xa0 at what science says about the\\xa0\\nactual wars that could happen. Actual Nuclear War Today there are two main conflicts that scientists\\xa0\\nthink about when making calculations of nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 winter: a nuclear war between India and\\xa0\\nPakistan and one between the US and Russia. The most likely smallish nuclear exchange would\\xa0\\nbe fought today between India and Pakistan,\\xa0\\xa0 with relatively low yield weapons. Even\\xa0\\nin a pretty mild nuclear war like this,\\xa0\\xa0 the immediate explosions would\\xa0\\nkill around 27 million people,\\xa0\\xa0 which is horrible enough. In just a few\\xa0\\nhours, more people would die than in all\\xa0\\xa0 of World War 1. The ensuing fires \\nwould\\xa0not cause a nuclear winter,  but a mild ‘nuclear\\xa0autumn’. But \\neven this would disrupt the climate,\\xa0\\xa0 and thereby global agriculture, enough to\\xa0\\nstarve up to 250 million people worldwide. Unfortunately India and Pakistan are in an\\xa0\\narms race and have been increasing the number\\xa0\\xa0 and power of warheads in their arsenal. The next\\xa0\\nstage of escalation would be war with hundreds of\\xa0\\xa0 nuclear weapons, the bombs and fires destroying\\xa0\\nmany major population centers and killing over\\xa0\\xa0 100 million people. A war on this scale would\\xa0\\ncause a nuclear winter that would damage global\\xa0\\xa0 agriculture enough to cut the available calories\\xa0\\nfor humanity in half. The number of\\xa0people that starve to death \\nwould be as high\\xa0as 2 billion. One in four humans alive today. The worst-case scenario is a full scale global\\xa0\\nwar between NATO nations and Russia – or China,\\xa0\\xa0 which also continues to build its nuclear\\xa0\\narsenal. In a war between a former,\\xa0\\xa0 future and current superpower, thousands\\xa0\\nof nuclear weapons could be detonated. In a scenario with around 4400 nuclear weapons,\\xa0\\n360 million people would perish right away. We\\xa0\\xa0 have no other event to even compare the death\\xa0\\nand destruction to. It's like humanity dropping\\xa0\\xa0 an asteroid on itself. The nuclear winter\\xa0\\nthat follows such an apocalyptic war would\\xa0\\xa0 tank human calorie production by as much\\xa0\\nas 90%. Not only would almost all of our\\xa0\\xa0 agriculture take an immediate and deadly\\xa0\\nhit, the climate would take at least a\\xa0\\xa0 decade to recover. Because a war like this would\\xa0\\nspecifically hit the world regions that produce\\xa0\\xa0 most of the food for humanity – recovery will\\xa0\\nbe much, much harder than with other conflicts. Within two years the global death toll from\\xa0\\nstarvation could rise to about 5 billion.\\xa0\\xa0 In mid latitude countries like Russia, China,\\xa0\\nCanada, the U.S. and much of Europe only a few\\xa0\\xa0 percent of the population might survive.\\xa0\\nHumanity will never be the same again. While nowhere is truly safe, some nations in\\xa0\\nthe southern hemisphere may fare well enough\\xa0\\xa0 to endure, while the rest of the world collapses.\\xa0\\nAll the nuclear weapon states are in the northern\\xa0\\xa0 hemisphere. So a few countries like Australia, New\\xa0\\nZealand, and Argentina may be able to endure for\\xa0\\xa0 a bunch of different reasons. Their nuclear winter\\xa0\\nwould be milder, they have a lot of livestock that\\xa0\\xa0 would not be as affected as crops. So they would\\xa0\\nprobably stop exporting food and focus on keeping\\xa0\\xa0 their own people alive – assuming they aren’t\\xa0\\ninvaded for their food by other starving nations. It's safe to say that the world would become\\xa0\\nextremely unpleasant for a long time and it's  impossible to know how many people will have\\xa0\\ndied when the nuclear winter ends. In the worst\\xa0\\xa0 case human civilization could collapse\\xa0\\nand the survivors would be thrown back\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of years, slowly trying to recover\\xa0\\na world full of scars and graves. Eventually,\\xa0\\xa0 when they've rebuilt civilization, would\\xa0\\nthey ever build nuclear weapons again? We know for sure that we need to do\\xa0\\nanything we can to make sure nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 war never happens.

The birbs really appreciate it!\", 'n/a', 'n/a', 'Do your past, present and future all exist\\xa0\\nright now? Are you watching this video,\\xa0\\xa0 being born and lying on your deathbed\\xa0\\nat this very moment? Surprisingly,\\xa0\\xa0 the answer could be yes. But how can that be?\\xa0\\nWhat does that even mean? How does time work? Imagine the universe like a child painting\\xa0\\npictures on paper. Each picture shows\\xa0\\xa0 everything that\\'s happening in the universe\\xa0\\nin a single moment. With each new moment,\\xa0\\xa0 all kinds of things occur everywhere – people\\xa0\\nare born and die, galactic civilizations expand,\\xa0\\xa0 you miss the bus – and our universe-kid makes\\xa0\\na new picture that replaces the old one. In this way you get something like a movie –\\xa0\\nonly the moment we\\'re in right now is real.\\xa0\\xa0 The past is what happened before, now\\xa0\\nit’s gone. The future is still to come\\xa0\\xa0 and hasn\\'t been drawn yet. This is kind\\xa0\\nof how time feels, right? Each moment\\xa0\\xa0 being replaced by the next one. The past\\xa0\\nis far behind us, the future doesn’t exist. But what if time is something else? What if the universe-kid has already finished all\\xa0\\nits drawings and stacks them on top of each other?\\xa0\\xa0 This way we get a block – a block of time that\\xa0\\ncontains the whole history of the universe. All\\xa0\\xa0 moments that have ever existed or will ever exist.\\xa0\\nBut in this block, in this stack of moments,\\xa0\\xa0 the past, the present and the future are\\xa0\\nequally real and exist at the same time. This feels wrong – the only things\\xa0\\nthat we perceive as real are those\\xa0\\xa0 things happening now. How can the past\\xa0\\nand future be real right now? The problem\\xa0\\xa0 is that according to the theory of\\xa0\\nrelativity, they kind of have to be. Heavily simplified, relativity says\\xa0\\nthat time and space are not separated,\\xa0\\xa0 but one connected spacetime. When you move\\xa0\\nthrough space, you are also moving through\\xa0\\xa0 the block. This means time passes differently\\xa0\\nfor different people, depending on how they\\xa0\\xa0 move through space relative to each other. And\\xa0\\nthis also means that what someone perceives as\\xa0\\xa0 “now” is a certain cut along the block – a cut\\xa0\\nthat will depend on how fast they are moving. So what you think is “now” is really only your\\xa0\\nnow – there are many different “nows” in the\\xa0\\xa0 universe and all of them are equally real. This\\xa0\\nalso means there is no universal past or future. Ok. This is a lot – how does this work? Imagine three alien spaceships a million light\\xa0\\nyears away. The first one just hovers in space,\\xa0\\xa0 not moving relative to you. You\\xa0\\nboth experience the same “now”,\\xa0\\xa0 the same present. If you had a magical\\xa0\\ninstantaneous internet connection,\\xa0\\xa0 you could do a video call right\\xa0\\nnow and chat about alien things. The second spaceship is flying away from us at 30\\xa0\\nkm/s, about 3 times faster than a human rocket.\\xa0\\xa0 It is moving differently through the block of\\xa0\\ntime than you are, which means its “now” is\\xa0\\xa0 different from yours. With the magical internet,\\xa0\\nthe aliens can talk to your ancestors in 1924,\\xa0\\xa0 when humanity was discovering the\\xa0\\nfirst galaxies outside the Milky Way. The third spaceship wants to visit Earth\\xa0\\nand is flying towards you at 30 km/s,\\xa0\\xa0 moving at the opposite angle of the\\xa0\\nsecond ship through the block of time.\\xa0\\xa0 It experiences yet another “now” – with the\\xa0\\nmagical internet, the aliens can talk to your\\xa0\\xa0 descendants in the year 2124, when humanity\\xa0\\nhas already built cities on Mars and Venus. Ok, so we have three different “nows” – so\\xa0\\nwhich one is correct? Well, that’s the problem.\\xa0\\xa0 Relativity is based on one powerful principle\\xa0\\n– cosmic democracy: the fact that the point of\\xa0\\xa0 view of all observers in the universe is equally\\xa0\\nvalid. All those “nows” have to be equally real.\\xa0\\xa0 But if this is the case, your past, present and\\xa0\\nyour future all have to exist at the same time,\\xa0\\xa0 right now! Because for the different\\xa0\\naliens, they all happen in their present. This means that the distinction between\\xa0\\nthe past, the present and the future is\\xa0\\xa0 an illusion. The universe is not a bunch\\xa0\\nof things evolving through time, like in a\\xa0\\xa0 movie – but a static block in which the past, the\\xa0\\npresent and the future all coexist and are real. How can that be? Well, think about a\\xa0\\ngalaxy outside the observable universe,\\xa0\\xa0 too far away to ever visit or see. But even\\xa0\\nif you can’t get there and don’t see it,\\xa0\\xa0 it is still real. The future might be the same! But if the past is not far behind us and the\\xa0\\nfuture actually exists, then… there is no\\xa0\\xa0 “movie”. Things don’t happen in the universe. The\\xa0\\nuniverse just “is” – like a frozen block of dead,\\xa0\\xa0 cosmic ice, with everything that will\\xa0\\never happen already written and decided. Is the Future Already Written? If all times coexist and are equally real,\\xa0\\nthen the future has to be already written. But that’s not how you experience things. It\\xa0\\nfeels like you can mold your future with your\\xa0\\xa0 decisions. It really feels like you\\'re free to\\xa0\\nchoose to stop watching YouTube to not miss the\\xa0\\xa0 bus. But if the future is set in stone, you\\xa0\\ncan’t “decide” anything. So are your choices\\xa0\\xa0 an illusion? Well… maybe. Maybe your free\\xa0\\nwill is a mirage. And maybe you missing the\\xa0\\xa0 bus was already predetermined at the Big\\xa0\\nBang, so feel free to continue watching. Except...quantum stuff is\\xa0\\nruining everything again. Quantum processes can’t be predicted, not even in\\xa0\\nprinciple. Not because we are silly and don’t know\\xa0\\xa0 how to do it – according to quantum physics,\\xa0\\nquantum particles are intrinsically random. For example, if you have a radioactive\\xa0\\natom, it could decay at any moment,\\xa0\\xa0 in the next second or in the next\\xa0\\nmillion years. We can calculate the\\xa0\\xa0 probability that it will decay tomorrow,\\xa0\\nbut no oracle in the universe will ever\\xa0\\xa0 be able to tell you with absolute\\xa0\\ncertainty if it will do so or not. But quantum particles can change the world. Imagine a radioactive element randomly decays and\\xa0\\ncauses a genetic mutation in a nearby mammal. And\\xa0\\xa0 then many generations later that mutation\\xa0\\nhas led to a weird mix of duck and mammal\\xa0\\xa0 that makes no sense. Or the atom decays a day\\xa0\\nlater and the weird creature will never exist. If quantum stuff is really uncertain, the\\xa0\\nfuture can’t be set in stone. But if the\\xa0\\xa0 future is an untold story, it can’t be\\xa0\\nreal in the same way as the past is. So what happens when uncertain\\xa0\\nthings, like the decay of our atom,\\xa0\\xa0 become real? Is that moment the present? Is\\xa0\\nthis “now”? But before we saw that cosmic\\xa0\\xa0 democracy makes it impossible to define\\xa0\\nan absolute “now”. What’s going on here? It turns out that for every individual\\xa0\\nobject – you, an alien, an atom – the past,\\xa0\\xa0 the present and the future are always\\xa0\\nwell defined. Your death will always\\xa0\\xa0 happen after your birth – never before, and\\xa0\\nnever at the same time. Now you are clearly\\xa0\\xa0 between your birth and your death. So for\\xa0\\nyou at least, \"now\" makes perfect sense. If we don’t play tricks like going to the\\xa0\\nother side of the universe and using aliens\\xa0\\xa0 in funny ways to find out what “now” means,\\xa0\\nthings again start to look ordered and nice,\\xa0\\xa0 and individual “nows” seem to exist.\\xa0\\nCan we do something with them? Let’s return to our block universe. Maybe the\\xa0\\nblock does not contain the future – and maybe\\xa0\\xa0 we just imagined it wrong. Maybe the block is just\\xa0\\nthe past, and a thin layer on the surface is the\\xa0\\xa0 present. That surface is not smooth, but bumpy\\xa0\\nand uneven. It’s been made by joining countless\\xa0\\xa0 individual “nows” – each experienced by\\xa0\\nsomeone or something in the universe,\\xa0\\xa0 each equally real and valid. And all observers\\xa0\\ndo their bit, so cosmic democracy is still true. As new things happen and uncertain things\\xa0\\nbecome certain –radioactive atoms decay,\\xa0\\xa0 new species of mammals arise, people\\xa0\\nmiss the bus– the border moves upward,\\xa0\\xa0 creating new time in the universe.\\xa0\\nInstead of a frozen block of time with\\xa0\\xa0 a future that has already been written,\\xa0\\nthe block is growing and things happen.\\xa0\\xa0 You can again decide your future! Maybe\\xa0\\nleave earlier so you won’t miss the bus! Let’s recap. We started with time as\\xa0\\na movie – one “now” after another,\\xa0\\xa0 where only the current “now” was real. Then\\xa0\\nwe found out that because of relativity there\\xa0\\xa0 are multiple “nows”, all of them real somehow –\\xa0\\nwhich could mean that we are living in a frozen\\xa0\\xa0 block universe where things don’t happen and\\xa0\\nyou don’t really have free will. And we ended\\xa0\\xa0 up with a kind of growing block universe,\\xa0\\nwhere time passes and the future is open. So which is correct? What is real? The present?\\xa0\\nThe past? Are the dinosaurs as real as you are\\xa0\\xa0 right now? What do the aliens on the other\\xa0\\ncorner of the universe think about all this? To be honest, no one knows. What we’ve learned\\xa0\\nare two possibilities to describe time, but\\xa0\\xa0 they\\'re not the only ones. Some scientists think\\xa0\\nthat the idea of “now” only makes sense near you,\\xa0\\xa0 but not in the universe as a whole. Others think\\xa0\\nthat time itself doesn’t even exist – that the\\xa0\\xa0 whole concept is an illusion of our human\\xa0\\nmind. And others think that time does exist,\\xa0\\xa0 but that it\\'s not a fundamental\\xa0\\nfeature of the universe – rather,\\xa0\\xa0 time may be something that emerges from a deeper\\xa0\\nlevel of reality, just like heat emerges from the\\xa0\\xa0 motion of individual molecules or life emerges\\xa0\\nfrom the interactions of lifeless proteins. We could go on, but… aren’t\\xa0\\nyou about to miss the bus? The concept of time is abstract and\\xa0\\nelusive, possibly beyond complete\\xa0\\xa0 human comprehension.

In the opposite\\xa0\\ndirection, six times smaller than you,\\xa0\\xa0 you get things like a cute squirrel about 27\\xa0\\ncentimetres small. So the building is just as\\xa0\\xa0 big relative to you as you are to a squirrel.\\xa0\\nYou're in the middle. It's easy to understand. In fact, you are in the middle of everything\\xa0\\nin the Universe. Let's go on a fantastical journey together, to the small and the\\xa0\\nlarge and see if it's really true! An A320 is 37 meters long. The\\xa0Rufous \\nhummingbird is around 7 centimetres. Both of these fliers are\\xa023 times \\nbigger or smaller than you,\\xa0\\xa0 and both fly intercontinental distances - the\\xa0\\ntiny bird migrates between Alaska and Mexico!\\xa0\\xa0 If the hummingbird were the same size as the jet,\\xa0\\nit would circle the Earth 85 times every year!

Kind of\\xa0\\xa0 unimaginable how something this small creates\\xa0\\nso much devastation for something that big. We are getting to the borders\\xa0\\nof human perception now. Like coarse grains of sand about 3\\xa0\\nmillimeters, 550 times smaller than you.\\xa0\\xa0 You can feel their shape and roughness\\xa0\\nbetween your fingers and if you focus,\\xa0\\xa0 see them individually. We mix them into concrete\\xa0\\nthat can hold up the tallest towers ever built,\\xa0\\xa0 like the 828 meter tall Burj Khalifa that is 500\\xa0\\ntimes larger than you. If you were that tall,\\xa0\\xa0 people would be as small to you as grains\\xa0\\nof sand in your hand. Hey! Be gentle. Anything smaller or bigger\\xa0\\nand it becomes hard to grasp. A medium sized city like Lisbon\\xa0\\nis about 6000 times larger than\\xa0\\xa0 yourself and permeated by a network\\xa0\\nof highways, roads and alleys. On the other end, about 6000 times smaller\\xa0\\nthan you, are your small arteries permeating\\xa0\\xa0 your whole body. Actually you are in the middle\\xa0\\nbetween your network of blood vessels and the\\xa0\\xa0 network of a city like Lisbon. If you think of\\xa0\\na city as a living being, you find more and more\\xa0\\xa0 parallels. A small alley is as small to the city\\xa0\\nas an arteriole 0.1 millimeters wide is to you.\\xa0\\xa0 Your tiniest capillaries are to you, what the\\xa0\\npipes bringing water to homes are to Lisbon. Going further, 100,000 times smaller than\\xa0\\nyou, we reach a typical skin cell about 30\\xa0\\xa0 micrometers in diameter, a Neutrophil is half as\\xa0\\nbig and one of your red blood cells is merely 7\\xa0\\xa0 micrometers. They are as small to you, as you\\xa0\\nare to the entire Tokyo Metropolitan Area,\\xa0\\xa0 the largest urban area in the world spanning\\xa0\\nover 160 km. You are so incredibly big,\\xa0\\xa0 filled with so much complexity, so many\\xa0\\ndifferent moving parts. Or are you just a\\xa0\\xa0 cell, in the human civilization\\xa0\\nsuperstructure? Are you both? Our steps are getting larger and larger now. Germany is around 875 km from North to South\\xa0\\nand the 4th biggest agricultural exporter in the\\xa0\\xa0 world. Rhizobia is a nitrogen-fixing bacteria up\\xa0\\nto 3 micrometers long and without it, that sort of\\xa0\\xa0 agricultural production is impossible. So we have\\xa0\\na country and a bacterium depending on each other,\\xa0\\xa0 and you are in the middle, both being roughly\\xa0\\n550,000 times larger or smaller than you. What about the whole Earth? It’s\\xa0\\nabout 12,700 km in diameter;\\xa0\\xa0 about 7.7 million times larger than you. On\\xa0\\nthe other side of the scale is Corynebacterium,\\xa0\\xa0 as little as 0.3 micrometers across, living\\xa0\\non your skin and eyes along with 100 billion\\xa0\\xa0 other bacteria. More than ten times\\xa0\\nmore than there are humans on earth. Again you are in the center. Right\\xa0\\nin the middle of something so large\\xa0\\xa0 that our civilization is a mere scratch on its\\xa0\\nsurface, and something so small and numerous you\\xa0\\xa0 never notice its presence even as it touches\\xa0\\nyou. Does that make you feel small, or big? From here on out, your brain is breaking a bit. 4 times wider than Earth is Neptune, a\\xa0\\ncold blue gas giant 49,500 km wide. The\\xa0\\xa0 largest planet though is Jupiter, 140,000\\xa0\\nkm in diameter. A titanic abyss shrouded\\xa0\\xa0 in terrible winds. You could drop Earth whole\\xa0\\ninto its depths and it would simply vanish. On the opposite scale we find\\xa0\\nthe deadly West Nile virus,\\xa0\\xa0 50 nanometers in diameter. Or one step down,\\xa0\\nthe spike proteins on a coronavirus, that open\\xa0\\xa0 up cells for its RNA payload – they are as small\\xa0\\nto you as you are to the planet Jupiter. You are\\xa0\\xa0 in the middle between gigantic planets and the\\xa0\\nworld of viruses. These tiny things. So deadly. Let that sink in – a tiny virus is\\xa0\\ntaking over and killing lung cells\\xa0\\xa0 up to 500 times larger than itself, with\\xa0\\nthe help of a tiny protein weapon. That is\\xa0\\xa0 like you trying to kill a giant the size\\xa0\\nof the Burj Khalifa with a screwdriver. But the real boss of the Solar System is the Sun.\\xa0\\nTen times bigger than Jupiter, a billion times\\xa0\\xa0 larger than you, controlling all the planets\\xa0\\nand source of all energy that drives life.\\xa0 A billion times smaller than you, clearly\\xa0\\nthe boss of our body is a DNA strand,\\xa0\\xa0 containing all the information making\\xa0\\nyour life possible. You’re right in the\\xa0\\xa0 middle between the most important\\xa0\\nfactors keeping everything alive. From here on on things just\\xa0\\nkind of stop making sense.\\xa0\\xa0 A billion is already too much but now\\xa0\\neverything just seems to mean ‘a lot’. The supermassive black hole at the\\xa0\\ncenter of our galaxy, Sagittarius A*,\\xa0\\xa0 is 14.5 billion times bigger than you.\\xa0\\nA hydrogen atom is 15.5 billion times\\xa0\\xa0 smaller than you. Yeah ok sure. But the\\xa0\\nthing is, we are not even close to being\\xa0\\xa0 done and it's not impossible to get\\xa0\\nat least a sense of how these scale. The solar system is 22 trillion times larger\\xa0\\nthan you – On the other end of the scale is the\\xa0\\xa0 wavelength of low energy neutrinos released\\xa0\\nfrom fusion reactions in our Sun – about\\xa0\\xa0 a hundred trillion of them are passing through\\xa0\\nyou every single second, like ghosts a trillion\\xa0\\xa0 times smaller than you, basically never hitting\\xa0\\nany of the particles inside you. If you moved\\xa0\\xa0 through the solar system in a straight line\\xa0\\nyou probably wouldn't hit anything either. Although things are beginning\\xa0\\nto get really weird now. A single proton at the heart of the\\xa0\\nhydrogen atom is almost exactly 1\\xa0\\xa0 quadrillion times smaller than you.\\xa0\\nIf the proton were as big as you,\\xa0\\xa0 the hydrogen atoms would be\\xa0\\ntaller than twelve Mt. Everests. On the other end, we meet something that\\xa0\\njust breaks human brains: the incredible\\xa0\\xa0 vastness of space, we just have no reference\\xa0\\nfor these distances at all. The distance to\\xa0\\xa0 the closest star to earth, Alpha Centauri, is\\xa0\\nnot 1 quadrillion times in the other direction\\xa0\\xa0 from the tiny proton – but 24 quadrillion.\\xa0\\nSpace is just so large it is kind of mean. And it goes on like this. A quintillion times smaller than you is the\\xa0\\nstrange world of the quarks. The proton is\\xa0\\xa0 not actually like a tiny ball but kind of\\xa0\\njust a ripple on the surface of the ocean\\xa0\\xa0 of quarks. Every moment, countless quarks pop into\\xa0\\nexistence, along with their anti-particle enemies,\\xa0\\xa0 before doing furious battle and annihilating each\\xa0\\nother in an instant. How many? Impossible to say,\\xa0\\xa0 because the harder you look for them\\xa0\\nthe more quarks seem to appear. We’re\\xa0\\xa0 simplifying so much it’s like a lie anyway.\\xa0\\nHowever we choose to illustrate this,\\xa0\\xa0 it's wrong. What actually is a quark, what\\xa0\\ndoes it look like to human minds? Nobody knows. As you sit here, confused, let’s look up\\xa0\\nagain. The ocean of quarks in a proton,\\xa0\\xa0 inside a single atom of a single\\xa0\\ncell of your body is as small to you,\\xa0\\xa0 as you are compared to a sphere around 174 light\\xa0\\nyears across, containing about 16 thousand stars. And this is just a tiny speck of dust\\xa0\\nto our galaxy. The Milky Way is close\\xa0\\xa0 to one sextillion times larger\\xa0\\nthan you. At the opposite end,\\xa0\\xa0 we have particles a sextillion\\xa0\\ntimes smaller than yourself;\\xa0\\xa0 like the wavelength of high energy neutrinos\\xa0\\nreleased when cosmic rays hit our atmosphere. We are getting to the end. The Observable Universe is 93 billion lightyears\\xa0\\nin diameter. Close to a billion billion billion\\xa0\\xa0 human lengths. But it’s still finite. It’s\\xa0\\n‘only’ 465,000 Milky Ways side by side. If\\xa0\\xa0 you were the size of our galaxy, the observable\\xa0\\nUniverse would only be a day’s drive across. On the other end of that scale, we have\\xa0\\nthe tiniest particle ever detected,\\xa0\\xa0 a proton travelling so close to the\\xa0\\nspeed of light it got squished into a\\xa0\\xa0 pancake. As small compared to you as the\\xa0\\nwhole Observable Universe is big to you. We are at the border of things that we have\\xa0\\nevidence for – are you truly in the middle\\xa0\\xa0 of everything? The theoretical smallest\\xa0\\nphysical distance is the Planck length,\\xa0\\xa0 a hundred million times smaller than even the\\xa0\\npancake proton. But we don’t know if it's real,\\xa0\\xa0 only that our theories of the universe\\xa0\\nbreak down here. Likewise on the other end,\\xa0\\xa0 does the bigness of the universe match\\xa0\\nthe smallness of the Planck length? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 actually the universe could be considerably\\xa0\\nlarger than that. But we will never know. Let’s go back and look at the dimensions again.\\xa0\\xa0 There are so many big things and so\\xa0\\nmany small things wrapped up in them.\\xa0\\xa0 The universe seems to be exactly the\\xa0\\nright size – with you in the middle. How do you try to get it exactly right,\\xa0\\nsay when you have to make a big choice\\xa0\\xa0 like buying a new mattress? You probably\\xa0\\ncompare trustworthy reviews and test out\\xa0\\xa0 a few models.

See you back at full throttle in January!\", \"Your tattoos are inside your immune system,\\xa0\\nliterally. With each very tasteful piece of art,\\xa0\\xa0 you kick start a drama with millions of deaths,\\xa0\\xa0 grand sacrifices and your immune system\\xa0\\nstepping in to protect you from yourself.\\xa0\\xa0 Let's give you a tattoo and zoom in\\xa0\\nto see what happens inside your skin. The Conveyor Belt of Death Your skin has to solve a huge problem – it's your\\xa0\\nlargest organ and has the most direct contact with\\xa0\\xa0 the world around you. Trillions of microbes, dirt,\\xa0\\ninsects and vermin can’t be allowed to get inside you – but your skin is also constantly\\xa0\\ndamaged by you moving through the world. Your body solved this by making your skin a\\xa0\\nconveyor belt of death. All the skin you see\\xa0\\xa0 is actually dead stuff. The alive part of your\\xa0\\nskin cells begins around one millimeter deep,\\xa0\\xa0 in the skin industrial complex. Stem cells\\xa0\\nconstantly clone themselves producing new\\xa0\\xa0 skin cells that begin a journey\\xa0\\nfrom the inside to the outside. Each new generation pushes the older ones\\xa0\\nfurther up. As your skin cells mature,\\xa0\\xa0 they interlock with each other and produce\\xa0\\nLamellar bodies, tiny bags that squirt out\\xa0\\xa0 fat to create a waterproof coat that\\xa0\\ncloses any gaps between them.  And then,\\xa0\\xa0they dry out and kill themselves,\\xa0\\nmerging together into inseparable lumps. This wall of dead corpses is consistently\\xa0\\npushed upwards. Up to 50 layers of dead\\xa0\\xa0 cells cover your whole body and are constantly\\xa0\\nreplaced by new cells moving up. Every hour,\\xa0\\xa0 you shed around 200,000,000 dead skin cells and\\xa0\\nall the dirt or bacteria that are stuck to them. Tattooing this part of your skin would be\\xa0\\xa0 useless as nothing would stick\\xa0\\naround. We need to go deeper. When the Fleshy World Explodes Below the conveyor belt of death lies the\\xa0\\ndermis. It's full of structural tissue and cells,\\xa0\\xa0 tiny blood vessels, sensory cells that report\\xa0\\nto nerve endings, the roots of your hairs,\\xa0\\xa0 sweat glands regulating your temperature.\\xa0\\nAnd of course loads of immune cells,\\xa0\\xa0 guarding your flesh right\\xa0\\nbelow the moving border wall. This region and below is where\\xa0\\nyour new tattoo will go. Ok! Ready? The world explodes. Half a dozen monoliths\\xa0\\nthe size of skyscrapers slam through the fifty\\xa0\\xa0 layers of dead cells, deep into the dermis,\\xa0\\nripping huge holes into the skin – only to\\xa0\\xa0 retreat and smash through the tissue again\\xa0\\nabout twice a second. Tens of thousands\\xa0\\xa0 of cells are violently killed right away,\\xa0\\nripped into pieces or damaged beyond repair. Luckily, you did your research and chose\\xa0\\na responsible tattoo artist who properly\\xa0\\xa0 disinfected their tools and your skin. But\\xa0\\nyou only ever get 99.9% of all bacteria,\\xa0\\xa0 and some of the survivors made it into your flesh.\\xa0 To put it mildly, your immune system is not\\xa0\\namused at all! All the death and destruction\\xa0\\xa0 wakes up hundreds of thousands of Macrophages in\\xa0\\nyour dermis, that rush into the open wounds to\\xa0\\xa0 defend you. Immediately they start killing\\xa0\\nbacteria, release chemicals that call for\\xa0\\xa0 reinforcements and order your blood vessels to\\xa0\\nopen up and make your dermis swell up with fluid. But worse than the hundreds of wounds\\xa0\\nand a few invaders is the tidal wave\\xa0\\xa0 of chemicals that floods your tissue. Tattoo\\xa0\\nink can be made from hundreds of substances,\\xa0\\xa0 some may even be toxic or carcinogenic.\\xa0\\nMost are from heavy metals like lead,\\xa0\\xa0 nickel or chromium dissolved in distilled water. The battlefield is now a wild mix of\\xa0\\ndead cell parts, a few panicked bacteria,\\xa0\\xa0 blood and bodily fluids, platelet\\xa0\\ncells trying to close wounds,\\xa0\\xa0 more and more fresh immune cells\\xa0\\nand the flood of tattoo ink. On the scale of your cells, clumps of\\xa0\\nink particles are huge – if you were\\xa0\\xa0 the size of a cell, they’d range from\\xa0\\nbig dogs to small office buildings. Your immune system has one main job: Identify\\xa0\\nwhat is not you and smash it until it's dead.\\xa0\\xa0 The Macrophages are desperately\\xa0\\ntrying to do that. Like tiny octopuses,\\xa0\\xa0 they extend arm-like structures and begin\\xa0\\npulling the ink particles inside. Usually,\\xa0\\xa0 when a Macrophage has eaten an enemy, it showers\\xa0\\nit in acid to dissolve it. But this doesn’t work\\xa0\\xa0 with the ink. They try and try but nothing\\xa0\\nworks, the particles don't react in any way. And this is just the particles\\xa0\\nsmall enough to be devoured. By now the larger chunks are surrounded \\nby\\xa0thousands of your structural skin cells and macrophages that are nomming on them,\\xa0\\nbathing them in acid and attack chemicals\\xa0\\xa0 trying to destroy and kill them. But\\xa0\\nthey are not moving even a tiny bit. Nothing works! Finally your immune system has to concede. It\\xa0\\nwill not win this fight – so it does the next\\xa0\\xa0 best thing: Not lose. Your cells don’t know\\xa0\\nhow dangerous these metals and chemicals are,\\xa0\\xa0 but they can at least not let them spread\\xa0\\naround. So they just stay in place. They\\xa0\\xa0 vacuum up all the particles they can fit\\xa0\\ninto their bodies and surround the larger\\xa0\\xa0 ones trapping them in the only prison they can\\xa0\\nbuild: themselves. Bit by bit, the ink inside\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of tiny wounds moves inside millions\\xa0\\nof immune cells that freeze in place forever. On the outside you don’t notice any of\\xa0\\nthis. Your new tattoo is fresh and the\\xa0\\xa0 colours vibrant. Your skin hurts and is\\xa0\\nirritated and swollen. But wounds heal,\\xa0\\xa0 tiny holes close, dead cells are replaced. Bit\\xa0\\nby bit, the conveyor belt of death does its job,\\xa0\\xa0 shedding dead cells ripe in colour, replacing\\xa0\\nthem with fresh and clean ones. Your tattoo\\xa0\\xa0 becomes a little less vibrant, now the ink\\xa0\\nis no longer on your skin but inside it. But what you are really seeing\\xa0\\nis millions of your Macrophages,\\xa0\\xa0 sitting in your dermis, patiently holding\\xa0\\nthe ink in place, protecting your body\\xa0\\xa0 from poison. Your immune system\\xa0\\nis why your tattoo is forever. Actually Nothing is Forever Over time your Macrophages get old and die\\xa0\\nand new ones come in to gobble up the ink\\xa0\\xa0 and keep it in place. But sometimes\\xa0\\na tiny bit of ink escapes. Most of it is recaptured and locked in place,\\xa0\\nbut not always the exact same place. You notice that as your tattoo fades out a bit\\xa0\\nand turns less sharp and crisp at its edges.\\xa0\\xa0 Some of the ink escapes the tattoo entirely.\\xa0\\nIt rides fluids flowing from your tissue\\xa0\\xa0 and spreads around your body, another reason\\xa0\\nwhy tattoo ink should ideally not be poison. Your immune system also kind of doesn’t want\\xa0\\nyou to remove tattoos – to do that usually the\\xa0\\xa0 ink is shot at with lasers, which heats up the\\xa0\\nparticles until they break into smaller chunks,\\xa0\\xa0 cooking your brave Macrophages in the\\xa0\\nprocess. With every round of lasering,\\xa0\\xa0 more of your tattoo is broken down and\\xa0\\ncarried away by fluids. But also every time new Macrophages rush into the tattoo\\xa0\\nto lock the ink in place. So like uhm,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe think about it carefully before you get the\\xa0\\nname of your new bae tattooed, but you do you. But if you got one, you can directly see\\xa0\\nyour immune system protecting you. This\\xa0\\xa0 is how much your body loves you, which\\xa0\\nis kind of sweet. And while tattoos are\\xa0\\xa0 probably not that big of a deal for your\\xa0\\nbody if applied correctly: you now know\\xa0\\xa0 about the struggle going on inside your skin\\xa0\\nand the sacrifice of your Macrophage buddies,\\xa0\\xa0 only for you to have that art forever. To appreciate your amazing immune system,\\xa0\\xa0 you have to know about it first – and the same\\xa0\\ngoes for anything going on in our universe. To help you with that, we’ve created a series\\xa0\\nof lessons to take your scientific knowledge to\\xa0\\xa0 the next level. Made in collaboration\\xa0\\nwith our friends at Brilliant.org,\\xa0\\xa0 these lessons let you further explore\\xa0\\nthe topics in our most popular videos,\\xa0\\xa0 from rabies and mammalian metabolism to climate\\xa0\\nscience and supernovae. Brilliant has thousands of\\xa0\\xa0 lessons to explore. And each one is interactive,\\xa0\\nlike a one-on-one version of a kurzgesagt video. Brilliant’s latest course, “How LLMs Work” takes\\xa0\\nyou under the hood of real language models. It\\xa0\\xa0 demystifies technologies like ChatGPT\\xa0\\nwith interactive lessons on everything\\xa0\\xa0 from how models build vocabulary to how\\xa0\\nthey choose their next word. You’ll learn\\xa0\\xa0 how to tune LLMs to produce output\\xa0\\nwith exactly your desired tonality,\\xa0\\xa0 whether it’s poetry or a cover letter. And you’ll\\xa0\\nunderstand why training is really everything,\\xa0\\xa0 by comparing models trained on Taylor\\xa0Swift \\nlyrics and the legal speech of Big\\xa0Tech’s  Terms and Conditions. This isn’t just\\xa0\\nanother course; it’s an immersive AI workshop,\\xa0\\xa0 allowing you to experience and harness the\\xa0\\nmechanics of today’s most advanced tool.

But how?\\xa0 Well, it turns out, our cosmic fate will\\xa0\\nbe decided by a fight between two titans. The Two Warriors Deciding the Fate of the Universe Our universe was born 14 billion years ago\\xa0\\nin the Big Bang and has been expanding ever\\xa0\\xa0 since. For some reason, new empty space\\xa0\\nis being created out of nothing between\\xa0\\xa0 galaxies. Space itself is becoming bigger.\\xa0\\nWill it go on forever, or will it stop one\\xa0\\xa0 day? Today we think the universe is at the mercy\\xa0\\nof two cosmic demigods fighting for dominance. The first one is all the stuff in the universe:\\xa0\\xa0 galaxies, gas, dark matter. While they are\\xa0\\nvery different they just want to do one thing: get together. Matter is attracted by matter,\\xa0\\npulled together by gravity. And gravity also\\xa0\\xa0 pulls on the universe as a whole, slowing\\xa0\\nthe expansion that started at the Big Bang. Our second warrior is empty space. While\\xa0\\nit seems, well, empty and powerless,\\xa0\\xa0 empty space has an intrinsic energy. We don’t\\xa0\\nreally have an idea what this energy is or\\xa0\\xa0 why it is there. It’s really a placeholder\\xa0\\nthat fills a blank in our understanding of\\xa0\\xa0 reality. But it’s got a cool name: dark\\xa0\\nenergy. Dark energy pushes things apart,\\xa0\\xa0 a sort of “anti-gravity” that\\xa0\\naccelerates the cosmic expansion.\\n\\xa0 So we have all the matter in the universe, pulling\\xa0\\nin, and empty space infused with dark energy,\\xa0\\xa0 pushing out. Whoever wins will kill the\\xa0\\nuniverse in fun ways. But who will win? It all depends on the mysterious dark energy:\\xa0\\xa0 Will its strength stay the same – a\\xa0\\ncommon assumption just because it keeps\\xa0\\xa0 our models simple? Or will it get weaker,\\xa0\\nor will it get more powerful over time? 1. Constant Dark Energy – Heat Death If the strength of dark energy stays constant, it\\xa0\\nwill win the war. Since space is growing, matter\\xa0\\xa0 is getting more and more diluted, like sugar\\xa0\\nin a cup being filled with more and more tea. But as the universe expands, new empty space\\xa0\\nis created, which brings more dark energy,\\xa0\\xa0 which pushes everything apart even\\xa0\\nmore , which creates more empty space,\\xa0\\xa0 which makes the universe grow even faster.\\xa0\\nA feedback loop that will make the universe\\xa0\\xa0 expand at an exponential rate. Every 12 billion\\xa0\\nyears or so it will double in diameter – forever. But while dark energy is winning the war,\\xa0\\xa0 matter is winning at least one\\xa0\\nbattle: At short distances,\\xa0\\xa0 it can keep things together. Local galaxy\\xa0\\nbubbles can overcome the push of dark energy. In a few billion years, our local group of\\xa0\\ngalaxies will merge into a gigantic ball with\\xa0\\xa0 trillions of stars. It will soon become our last\\xa0\\nview of the cosmos. All other galaxies will be\\xa0\\xa0 pushed away by the expansion. For us, it will look\\xa0\\nlike the rest of the universe is rushing away,\\xa0\\xa0 until in a few hundred billion years we won’t\\xa0\\nsee other galaxies at all. We will be alone,\\xa0\\xa0 surrounded by a seemingly infinite, dark void. In about 100 trillion years, all the stars of\\xa0\\nour supergalaxy will have died out. All gas\\xa0\\xa0 that could create new stars has been consumed,\\xa0\\nand no new gas can come in. The galaxy will\\xa0\\xa0 be dark and filled with stellar corpses. Over\\xa0\\nquadrillions of years, white dwarfs and neutron\\xa0\\xa0 stars will slowly cool until becoming truly dark\\xa0\\n– turning off the last lights of the universe. All structures, big and small,\\xa0\\nwill slowly dissolve. One by one,\\xa0\\xa0 all dead stars and planets will leave the\\xa0\\nsupergalaxy, which slowly dissolves over\\xa0\\xa0 sextillions of years. Every object will\\xa0\\nend up on its own, which means that dark\\xa0\\xa0 energy takes over again, creating more\\xa0\\nand more empty space between everything. Objects will be so far apart that it will\\xa0\\nbe as if each had a universe for itself.\\xa0\\xa0 Not much happens anymore, until in a googol\\xa0\\nyears, all black holes will have evaporated. In the end, entropy and dark energy won’t\\xa0\\nstop until their job is finished. Over time\\xa0\\xa0 spans you might as well call forever, all\\xa0\\nremaining structures might even dissolve\\xa0\\xa0 into single particles that will be pushed away\\xa0\\nfrom each other by an ever growing empty space.\\xa0\\xa0 Imagine a whole universe – with just a single,\\xa0\\nlonely particle traveling through nothingness.\\xa0\\xa0 This is the final state, the true end. The Big\\xa0\\nFreeze, or Heat Death. A completely featureless,\\xa0\\xa0 cold and eternally expanding universe. Nothing\\xa0\\nwill ever be able to happen again. Forever. Well that was a bummer! What else could happen? 2. Increasing Dark Energy – Big Rip What if dark energy gets stronger? In\\xa0\\nthis case empty space won’t just win\\xa0\\xa0 over matter – it will literally rip it to pieces. In the Big Freeze scenario, matter lost\\xa0\\nthe war but won some battles. But here\\xa0\\xa0 matter wins nothing. Dark energy is growing\\xa0\\nstronger over time, overcoming the pull of\\xa0\\xa0 gravity and creating new empty space at smaller\\xa0\\nand smaller distances. In this scenario things\\xa0\\xa0 will escalate quickly – it could start\\xa0\\nas early as 20 billion years from now. First, dark energy will create empty space\\xa0\\nbetween individual galaxies. Our galaxy will\\xa0\\xa0 leave its local cluster and begin to drift alone\\xa0\\nin a rapidly inflating and ever darker cosmos. Some billion years later empty space\\xa0\\nstarts to push between individual stars,\\xa0\\xa0 dissolving the galaxy. If you live on a\\xa0\\nplanet in a star system, the night sky\\xa0\\xa0 will start looking sad and gloomy, as other\\xa0\\nstars are pushed too far away to be seen. A few million years after the sky turns dark,\\xa0\\xa0 dark energy starts to create empty space\\xa0\\ninside star systems. Your planet is pushed\\xa0\\xa0 away from its star and all life in the universe\\xa0\\nfreezes to death. There is not much time left,\\xa0\\xa0 as a few months later dark energy is\\xa0\\ncreating empty space inside solid objects. Stars, neutron stars, planets, asteroids,\\xa0\\neverything solid is being ripped into pieces. If you're on a spaceship, you only have a short time\\xa0\\nbefore you are ripped apart. Half an hour later,\\xa0\\xa0 even atoms are destroyed as new space is\\xa0\\nbeing created so furiously that electrons\\xa0\\xa0 and nuclei are separated. Now the universe\\xa0\\nhas just a fraction of a second left. In this final moment, only dying black\\xa0\\nholes remain, drained and defeated by\\xa0\\xa0 dark energy. They are tiny, septillions\\xa0\\nof times smaller than an atom – and they\\xa0\\xa0 explode with the power of a trillion supernovae\\xa0\\nin a trillionth of an octillionth of a second. Finally, the very fabric of reality is torn to its\\xa0\\ncore, obliterating spacetime itself. The Big Rip.\\xa0\\xa0 Space and time have lost their meanings, making\\xa0\\nit impossible to predict what will happen next. Oof. 3. Decreasing Dark Energy – Big Crunch Poor matter. But there is\\xa0\\none scenario where it wins:\\xa0\\xa0 If the strength of dark energy decreases with\\xa0\\ntime, and if this reduction is strong enough,\\xa0\\xa0 the pull of gravity will win and\\xa0\\nall the things in existence will\\xa0\\xa0 move towards each other – unfortunately\\xa0\\nmaking the universe collapse into itself. No one knows when this might begin,\\xa0\\xa0 but it could be as soon as a few hundred\\xa0\\nmillion years. What will it look like? As the universe begins to contract, over\\xa0\\nbillions of years, galaxies and galaxy\\xa0\\xa0 clusters approach each other until they eventually\\xa0\\ncollide. They are mostly made of empty space,\\xa0\\xa0 so a collision is like the gentle\\xa0\\nmerger of two clouds. At any rate,\\xa0\\xa0 first galaxies and later individual\\xa0\\nstars get closer and closer. As the universe goes on collapsing, you might\\xa0\\nworry about stars and planets eventually crashing\\xa0\\xa0 against each other. This will happen, but it’s\\xa0\\nnot your worst problem. If space itself shrinks,\\xa0\\xa0 this also concentrates all the radiation emitted\\xa0\\nin the past by all the stars, supernovae and\\xa0\\xa0 quasars that ever existed. Now ‘empty’ space is\\xa0\\nfilled with radiation, the dark nothing between\\xa0\\xa0 stars is heating up, making life unpleasant and\\xa0\\nthen impossible as planets just burn. Slowly at\\xa0\\xa0 first, then rapidly, space gets as hot as it\\xa0\\nwas after the Big Bang. Stars are pretty hot,\\xa0\\xa0 but now the space around them is hotter\\xa0\\n–they are literally boiled from the outside. As the universe collapses into\\xa0\\nitself, all galaxies and all\\xa0\\xa0 stars merge into a single ball of hot\\xa0\\nplasma – the Big Crunch is complete. From here on there are two possibilities.\\xa0\\nEither the universe will collapse completely\\xa0\\xa0 into a singularity, a point of zero size and\\xa0\\ninfinite density, without space and time.\\xa0\\xa0 The way it might have been before the Big\\xa0\\nBang. Or the universe could “bounce back”,\\xa0\\xa0 restarting the cosmic expansion, creating a\\xa0\\nnew baby universe. Somewhat poetic really,\\xa0\\xa0 everything died, but everything\\xa0\\nis reborn. But to be clear,\\xa0\\xa0 we have zero evidence that this has\\xa0\\nhappened before or will in the future. So What Will Happen? Most scientists think that dark energy will\\xa0\\nstay constant, so the likely fate of the\\xa0\\xa0 universe is Heat Death – eternal cold and utter\\xa0\\nboredom. Which seems sad but has a huge upside:\\xa0\\xa0 In this scenario we get to have the universe for\\xa0\\nthe longest. It gives us trillions of years to\\xa0\\xa0 expand, jump from star to star, maybe even\\xa0\\nfrom galaxy to galaxy. We might even find a\\xa0\\xa0 way to keep consciousness around forever. We\\xa0\\ndon’t know. So we just have to wait and see,\\xa0\\xa0 and make the most of the amazing\\xa0\\nuniverse we have right now.\", \"Hey you, so nice of you to join\\xa0\\nus!

But creating animated\\xa0\\nscience videos that are free for everyone,\\xa0\\xa0 doesn’t pay the bills – DAMN YOU reality!\\xa0\\nIn order to make ends meet we had to take\\xa0\\xa0 on “real jobs” during the day and create\\xa0\\nkurzgesagt videos at night. It was tough\\xa0\\xa0 but our dream of inspiring people\\xa0\\nall around the world kept us going. Then in 2016 everything changed.\\nKurzgesagt’s founder, Philipp Dettmer\\xa0\\xa0 had an idea. He wanted to create something\\xa0\\ninspiring that would extend beyond the\\xa0\\xa0 digital YouTube cosmos. Something tangible.\\nSomething that would represent kurzgesagt’s\\xa0\\xa0 view of the world and our belief in\\xa0\\nhumanity’s potential for greatness. His idea: the kurzgesagt Human Era Calendar.\\xa0\\nIt establishes a new year zero to include all\\xa0\\xa0 people and cultures around the world. This\\xa0\\nnew year zero, roughly 12,000 years ago,\\xa0\\xa0 signifies a time when humans first started\\xa0\\nworking together on a larger scale,\\xa0\\xa0 laying the foundation for modern society\\xa0\\nand eventually our future ahead of us. The first Human Era Calendar was a\\xa0\\nhuge success, it sold out within a\\xa0\\xa0 few hours and inspired thousands of birbs\\xa0\\naround the globe. Every year since then,\\xa0\\xa0 we’ve created a new edition of the Human\\xa0\\nEra Calendar – each one more spectacular\\xa0\\xa0 and successful than the last.

And it's not just the US but around the world. People increasingly\\xa0\\nsee themselves as part of opposing teams. There are many different reasons\\xa0\\nfor this, but one gets blamed a lot:\\xa0\\xa0 social media. Social media divides us,\\xa0\\nmakes us more extreme and less empathetic,\\xa0\\xa0 it riles us up or sucks us into doom scrolling,\\xa0\\xa0 making us stressed and depressed. It feels like we\\xa0\\nneed to touch grass and escape to the real world. New research shows that we might have\\xa0\\nlargely misinterpreted why this is the\\xa0\\xa0 case. It turns out that the social media\\xa0\\ninternet may uniquely undermine the way\\xa0\\xa0 our brains work but not in the way you think. The Myth of the Filter Bubble You've probably heard about online filter bubbles:\\xa0\\nAlgorithms give you exactly what you want, or what\\xa0\\xa0 they think you want. You only see information\\xa0\\nthat shows you opinions that agree with yours,\\xa0\\xa0 while dissenting opinions or information are\\xa0\\nfiltered out. Since you only see content close to\\xa0\\xa0 your world view, more extreme and toxic opinions\\xa0\\nsuddenly seem less extreme. You are trapped in a\\xa0\\xa0 radicalising filter bubble and your view of\\xa0\\nthe world becomes narrower and more extreme. But is that true? Extreme filter bubbles seem to be rather rare\\xa0 Studies that investigated what people actually\\xa0\\nlook at online or are shown by search engines,\\xa0\\xa0 found little evidence that you are ideologically\\xa0\\nisolated. It is the exact opposite: Online you\\xa0\\xa0 are constantly confronted with opinions\\xa0\\nand world views that are not your own. It turns out the place where you are the most\\xa0\\nideologically isolated is your real life,\\xa0\\xa0 in the real world, with real people. Your\\xa0\\nreal world interactions with your friends,\\xa0\\xa0 family, colleagues and neighbors are\\xa0\\nmuch less diverse than your online\\xa0\\xa0 bubble. The filter bubble exists\\xa0\\nin your real life, not online.\\xa0 Ok wait. Online filter bubbles have been\\xa0\\nthe prevailing explanation as to why we’ve\\xa0\\xa0 all started hating each other more over the\\xa0\\nlast two decades. If that's not the case,\\xa0\\xa0 shouldn’t the internet open our minds and\\xa0\\nmake us more empathetic with each other? Unfortunately your brain is stupid. Your Brain is Stupid Human brains didn’t evolve to understand the true\\xa0\\nnature of reality, but to navigate and maintain\\xa0\\xa0 social structures. Our ancestors desperately\\xa0\\nneeded each other to survive, so our brains\\xa0\\xa0 had to make sure we cooperated. That's why social\\xa0\\nisolation or exclusion feels so horrible, because\\xa0\\xa0 it was actually life threatening. A tribe that\\xa0\\nworked together survived, a divided tribe died. The way communities worked for\\xa0\\nthousands of years is that, sure,\\xa0\\xa0 you may have disliked a neighbour, but because\\xa0\\nyou lived close to each other, you also rooted\\xa0\\xa0 for the same sports club or saw them at the\\nchurch. You both thought that the people from\\xa0\\xa0 the other village were idiots. Being physically\\xa0\\nclose made you familiar and created similarities\\xa0\\xa0 that bridged the gap of different world views so\\xa0\\nyou didn’t murder each other. And your world view\\xa0\\xa0 was probably not that different in the first place\\xa0\\nbecause it was formed by the same local culture. When our brains evolved, this was enough. Whoever\\xa0\\nwas around, was similar to us. We liked what was\\xa0\\xa0 similar to us – this kept us aligned enough\\xa0\\nto work together despite our differences.\\xa0 As humanity moved on from small tribes to towns\\xa0\\nand cities, from chiefdoms to kingdoms to nations,\\xa0\\xa0 our brains and our communities had to adapt to\\xa0\\nmore diverse sets of neighbours. We began to meet\\xa0\\xa0 on the town square or in universities\\xa0\\nwhere we argued and screamed at each\\xa0\\xa0 other – but in the grand scheme of things\\xa0\\ncommunities were still relatively isolated,\\xa0\\xa0 we were still pretty similar and\\xa0\\naligned with the people around us. Conflict and disagreement are not\\xa0\\na bad thing per se. Tension over\\xa0\\xa0 how we should live can create new\\xa0\\nand wonderful things. Our values,\\xa0\\xa0 norms and taboos are always evolving\\xa0\\nand whatever we think is normal today,\\xa0\\xa0 will not be normal in the future. But we also\\xa0\\nneed social glue to hold our societies together,\\xa0\\xa0 because our brains don’t care about the meta\\xa0\\nlevel of humanity but about being safe in a tribe. Until about 20 years ago\\xa0\\nwe did something truly new,\\xa0\\xa0 that hit our brains like a freight train: the\\xa0\\nsocial media internet, the digital town square. Don’t You Dare Disagree With Me – Social Sorting In a nutshell: Our brains are not able\\xa0\\nto process the amount of disagreement we\\xa0\\xa0 encounter on the social internet. The very\\xa0\\nmechanisms that made it possible for our\\xa0\\xa0 ancestors to work together in the first place\\xa0\\nare derailed in ways we were not prepared for. Whether you want it to or not, your brain\\xa0\\nsorts people by world views and opinions,\\xa0\\xa0 into teams. This is not simply tribalism,\\xa0\\xa0 it goes further. Researchers have\\xa0\\ncalled this process social sorting. On the digital town square you encounter people\\xa0\\nthat express opinions or share information\\xa0\\xa0 that clash with your worldview. But unlike your\\xa0\\nneighbour, they don't root for your local sports\\xa0\\xa0 club. You are missing the local social glue your\\xa0\\nbrain needs to align with them. For your brain,\\xa0\\xa0 the disagreement between yourself and them\\xa0\\nbecomes a central part of their identity.\\xa0 And this makes it less likely that\\xa0\\nyou will seriously consider their\\xa0\\xa0 position or opinion in the future.\\xa0\\nIf you hear bad things about them,\\xa0\\xa0 your brain is much more likely\\xa0\\nto believe it uncritically. On the flipside, there are people who\\xa0\\nshare your world view and are maybe\\xa0\\xa0 even more similar to you than many people\\xa0\\nin your real life. Which makes your brain\\xa0\\xa0 like them a lot and kind of hyper align with\\xa0\\nthem. People who think like you are probably\\xa0\\xa0 good people because you are a good person and\\xa0\\nwhatever social group you belong to is good!\\xa0\\xa0 So your brain is more likely to believe their\\xa0\\nopinions. If you hear bad things about them,\\xa0\\xa0 your brain is much more likely\\xa0\\nto dismiss it uncritically. The engagement driven social internet makes it\\xa0\\nworse because it wants to keep you online as\\xa0\\xa0 long as possible. And the most engaging emotion\\xa0\\nis, unfortunately: Anger. The more angry you get,\\xa0\\xa0 the more likely you are to share and engage,\\xa0\\nand this leads to social media amplifying the\\xa0\\xa0 most extreme and controversial opinions. It\\xa0\\noptimises not only to show us disagreement,\\xa0\\xa0 but the worst disagreement possible. And because\\xa0\\nyour stupid brain is sorting people into teams,\\xa0\\xa0 whatever the worst opinions are, it assigns the\\xa0\\nsame opinions to everybody on the other team. What is striking and new about online polarisation\\xa0\\nis that all the aspects of our lives that make\\xa0\\xa0 us individuals, our lifestyle choices, the\\xa0\\ncomedians or shows we watch, our religion,\\xa0\\xa0 sense of fashion and so on are condensed,\\xa0\\nmaking it seem that they are parts of\\xa0\\xa0 opposing and mutually exclusive identities.\\nThis simplifies and distorts disagreements about how we should run society so much that\\xa0\\nit often seems as if the people on the other\\xa0\\xa0 team are actively, willfully making the\\xa0\\nworld worse. That they are almost evil,\\xa0\\xa0 beyond convincing with rationality, facts or civil\\xa0\\ndiscussion. While you are of course on the correct\\xa0\\xa0 team, it may be hard to process that you may\\xa0\\nseem like that to people on the other team. On a societal level this is dissolving the\\xa0\\nsocial glue that is the foundation of our\\xa0\\xa0 democracies. If we think our neighbours\\xa0\\nare evil, how can we live together? This is especially bad in the US, where the\\xa0\\ntwo party system makes it extra easy to think\\xa0\\xa0 of people in terms of teams – negative opinion\\xa0\\nabout the other party has reached record highs. Ok. Is there something we can learn\\xa0\\nfrom this? Is there something we can do? Something more positive – Opinion Part In the end, It is important to be\\xa0\\naware of what social media does to\\xa0\\xa0 your brain. It's easier to change\\xa0\\nyourself than to change the world,\\xa0\\xa0 so you can self examine why you believe the\\xa0\\nthings you believe and whether you dismiss\\xa0\\xa0 or believe information based on who the\\xa0\\nperson is who is stating that information. The internet comes with a lot of\\xa0\\nups and downs and just like we\\xa0\\xa0 had to adapt from living in small tribes\\xa0\\nto living in cities, we need to adapt to\\xa0\\xa0 the information age where we have access to\\xa0\\nbillions of people. Evolution is too slow,\\xa0\\xa0 so we need to find models that work with\\xa0\\nwhat our brains are able to tolerate. One model that seemed to work well was the pre\\xa0\\nsocial media internet old people might remember: Bulletin boards, forums, blogs. The\\xa0\\nmain difference to today was twofold:\\xa0\\xa0 For one there were no algorithms fighting to\\xa0\\nkeep you online at anycost – at some point\\xa0\\xa0 you were done with the internet for the\\xa0\\nday, as mind blowing as this may sound. But more importantly: The old internet\\xa0\\nwas very fractured, split into thousands\\xa0\\xa0 of different communities, like small villages\\xa0\\ngathering around shared beliefs and interests.\\xa0\\xa0 These villages were separated from each\\xa0\\nother by digital rivers or mountains. These communities worked because they mirrored\\xa0\\nreal life much more than social media:\\xa0\\xa0 Each village had its own culture and set of rules.\\xa0\\nMaybe one community was into rough humour and soft\\xa0\\xa0 moderation, another had strict rules and banned\\xa0\\neasily. If you didn’t play by the village rules,\\xa0\\xa0 you would be banned – or you could just go and\\xa0\\nmove to another village that suited you better. So instead of all of us gathering in one\\xa0\\nplace, overwhelming our brains at a town\\xa0\\xa0 square that in the end just leads to us\\xa0\\ngoing insane, one solution to achieve less\\xa0\\xa0 social sorting may be extremely simple:\\xa0\\ngo back to smaller online communities. Because what our stupid brains don’t realize\\xa0\\nis that we are actually all on the same team:\\xa0\\xa0 Humanity, on a wet rock speeding through space\\xa0\\nin a universe that doesn’t think about us.\\xa0\\xa0 We are all in this together – but until our\\xa0\\nbrains adjust to being able to deal with that,\\xa0\\xa0 we might be better off being a tiny bit separated. One of the worst things about the media we\\xa0\\nconsume is that most news organizations tend\\xa0\\xa0 to cater to one team, making you\\xa0\\nfeel you are on the correct side.\\xa0 Ground News, the sponsor of this video, is\\xa0\\ntrying to make these biases more transparent\\xa0\\xa0 by giving you tools that help you think\\xa0\\ncritically about the information you\\xa0\\xa0 consume – a mission we wholeheartedly\\xa0\\nsupport.

But at some point the night will turn\\xa0\\ndark. Everything that once was\\xa0 will peacefully sleep forever. But what\\xa0\\nis the last thing that will ever happen\\xa0\\xa0 and when will it be? It turns out there\\xa0\\nis such a thing and you probably haven’t\\xa0\\xa0 heard about it. Let's travel to the end of\\xa0\\nthe universe and look at the last thing. After a messy birth our universe was a sleepy\\xa0\\nbaby, warm and dark, filled with swirling clouds\\xa0\\xa0 of hot hydrogen and helium. The story of creation\\xa0\\nis a story of this gas and where it will end up. Shortly after, the universe got busy making\\xa0\\nthe first generation of stars. They were\\xa0\\xa0 massive and lived violent lives, forging new\\xa0\\nelements, only to release most of them when\\xa0\\xa0 they blew up. Countless stars were born and\\xa0\\nrefined the gas available in the universe,\\xa0\\xa0 cycling matter around, each generation giving\\xa0\\nmost of its gas and fresh elements to the next. But not all gas is returned. Every time a\\xa0\\nnew generation of stars forms, they also\\xa0\\xa0 make more and more red dwarfs that burn slowly\\xa0\\nand live for trillions of years. When they die,\\xa0\\xa0 they don’t give their gas back to the universe\\xa0\\nbut turn into white dwarfs. So red dwarfs lock\\xa0\\xa0 up more gas forever. Some more gas is locked\\xa0\\nforever in other remains of dead stars:\\xa0\\xa0 neutron stars and black holes. Which is bad, as\\xa0\\nit reduces the material available for new stars. Today the universe is a great\\xa0\\nhome for us and will remain so\\xa0\\xa0 for billions of years. But most of\\xa0\\nthe gas has been used up or trapped.\\xa0\\xa0 Over 90% of the stars that will\\xa0\\never be born have been born already. To get to\\xa0the last thing to ever happen, \\nall other things need to happen first. The next few hundred billion years\\xa0\\nwill be fun and a great time for\\xa0\\xa0 galactic exploration – but step by\\xa0\\nstep, large stars and stars like\\xa0\\xa0 our sun will die out. Eventually almost all\\xa0\\nthe stars will be red dwarfs slowly dying. The End of Everything – but not quite In a few trillion years the\\xa0\\ncosmic gas will finally have\\xa0\\xa0 run out. About 88% of the mass of\\xa0\\nevery galaxy will be white dwarfs,\\xa0\\xa0 2% neutron stars and black holes, and about\\xa0\\n10% gas giants and sad brown dwarf losers. White dwarfs are the corpses of old stars, not\\xa0\\nmuch bigger than earth but on average as massive\\xa0\\xa0 as half our sun, some even much more. This makes\\xa0\\nthem the third densest objects in the universe,\\xa0\\xa0 after neutron stars and black holes.\\xa0\\nAbout a 1,000,000 times denser than\\xa0\\xa0 the sun today. Since they used to be active\\xa0\\nstars, their surface can be as hot as 150,000\\xa0\\xa0 degrees. White dwarfs are dim, hot, dense\\xa0\\nspheres that don’t do anything anymore. But eventually even white dwarfs will die because\\xa0\\nthey are slowly losing their heat – it takes at\\xa0\\xa0 least 10 trillion years, more than 700 times\\xa0\\nlonger than the current age of the universe.\\xa0\\xa0 As they do their cooling down, the universe\\xa0\\naround them will irreversibly grow dark,\\xa0\\xa0 as more and more white dwarfs burn\\xa0\\nout, and turn into dead husks:\\xa0\\xa0 black dwarfs. Spheres of death, as cold as space\\xa0\\nitself, invisible against the dark backdrop. Over trillions and trillions of years,\\xa0\\xa0 every object in every galaxy is\\xa0\\neventually either ejected into\\xa0\\xa0 the void or its orbit decays and it will fall\\xa0\\ninto the central black hole and be destroyed. In about a quintillion years, all galaxies\\xa0\\nhave evaporated and every object is on its own,\\xa0\\xa0 in the center of its own observable universe,\\xa0\\nemptiness as far as can be seen in any direction,\\xa0\\xa0 traveling through black nothingness.\\xa0\\nStill, there are things that will happen. Black holes are dying. Slowly. They’ll fizzle\\xa0\\naway by emitting Hawking radiation until they\\xa0\\xa0 are so small that they die in a final flash\\xa0\\nof light. This will take about a googol years,\\xa0\\xa0 10 to the power of 100 years, until the last\\xa0\\nsuper massive black hole dies. A number so absurd,\\xa0\\xa0 there is nothing to compare it to.\\xa0\\nMaybe some living beings could have\\xa0\\xa0 survived around black holes – but even\\xa0\\nthis science fiction option ends now. After this unsettling amount of time we are not\\xa0\\neven close to the end. Now is the time of the\\xa0\\xa0 black dwarfs. It turns out there is some weird\\xa0\\nphysics going on inside the dead husk of stars! The Weird Physics of Black Dwarfs A black dwarf is a sphere the size of earth,\\xa0\\nas massive as a star but almost as cold as\\xa0\\xa0 absolute zero. Stars stay alive because\\xa0\\ntheir intense heat in their cores – so\\xa0\\xa0 why do black dwarfs not collapse into\\xa0\\na black hole? What keeps them together? Deep inside a black dwarf, matter is squeezed\\xa0\\nto densities millions of times greater than\\xa0\\xa0 anything we see on earth. The pressure is so great\\xa0\\nthat electrons can’t combine with nuclei to form\\xa0\\xa0 atoms. Instead matter is weird, degenerate: the\\xa0\\nnuclei are compressed by the weight of the star,\\xa0\\xa0 locked into a rigid lattice, while the\\xa0\\nelectrons form a plasma between them. And these electrons hold the star\\xa0\\ntogether. We are simplifying,\\xa0\\xa0 but imagine matter as a subway train\\xa0\\nand electrons as passengers. If there\\xa0\\xa0 are empty seats passengers spread out because\\xa0\\nthey care a lot about their personal space. But as a black dwarf is so incredibly\\xa0\\ndense, this is like squishing more and\\xa0\\xa0 more passengers into our train. Gravity\\xa0\\nis pushing in, trying to collapse it. The\\xa0\\xa0 Passengers are forced to sit and stand\\xa0\\nclose together, which they hate. And so\\xa0\\xa0 the passengers, our electrons try to push\\xa0\\nout against gravity as hard as they can. This way the electrons that are having a horrible\\xa0\\ntime in the crowded train that is the black dwarf,\\xa0\\xa0 hold up the star. Everything else in\\xa0\\nthe universe may have crumbled already,\\xa0\\xa0 these tiny particles push against each other\\xa0\\nuntil the end of time. Or they would – if\\xa0 quantum mechanics didn’t ruin everything. Simplifying a lot: when particles get close\\xa0\\nenough, sometimes they can jump at each other\\xa0\\xa0 and fuse together. A process called ‘quantum\\xa0\\ntunneling’. This happens constantly in stars\\xa0\\xa0 because of their intense heat. It is one of the\\xa0\\nkey reasons stars can fuse elements into new\\xa0\\xa0 ones. But it also happens at a temperature near\\xa0\\nabsolute zero. Just, well, mind numbingly slowly. This is the final step to creating the last\\xa0\\ninteresting thing to ever happen in our universe. Here, in this lone black dwarf something fantastic\\xa0\\noccurs. Nothing happens for a trillion years.\\xa0\\xa0 Nothing at all. Can you imagine that? But\\xa0\\nthen! A single fusion reaction: two carbon\\xa0\\xa0 nuclei combine by quantum tunneling to become\\xa0\\nmagnesium! Another 100 trillion years pass. It\\xa0\\xa0 happens again! Then nothing for another bazillion\\xa0\\nyears. Oh! Two oxygen nuclei combine into silicon! As eons pass, the nuclei in the frozen black\\xa0\\ndwarf slowly combine. Making new heavier\\xa0\\xa0 nuclei. And these take even longer to fuse,\\xa0\\nbut given enough time they eventually will. Remember the breathtaking amount of time\\xa0\\nit took for a supermassive black hole to\\xa0\\xa0 evaporate? That's a brief moment\\xa0in \\ncomparison to what's going on here. The difference between a second and\\xa0\\ntrillions of years has lost all meaning.\\xa0\\xa0 Over a time so absurd that it has no name,\\xa0\\nnuclei keep fusing into heavier elements. Until, when silicon nuclei fuse, they\\xa0\\nform Nickel-56. Nickel-56 is radioactive,\\xa0\\xa0 which means it is unstable. And when it\\xa0\\neventually decays and turns into iron,\\xa0\\xa0 it emits two positrons – antimatter electrons. And these two positrons,\\xa0\\xa0 find two electrons and annihilate them\\xa0\\nand themselves. Which is a problem. Remember how the uncomfortable electrons\\xa0\\nproduce the pressure to hold the star\\xa0\\xa0 together? Destroying the electron means\\xa0\\nfewer friends to help them hold up the\\xa0\\xa0 star. Losing an electron does not give\\xa0\\nthem more space to scratch their butts,\\xa0\\xa0 it just makes gravity squeeze harder, the\\xa0\\nwalls closing in on those that remain. In the case of the most massive black\\xa0\\ndwarfs this is catastrophic. Bit by bit,\\xa0\\xa0 the black dwarf turns into a sphere of\\xa0\\niron, and more electrons are annihilated. For at least 10^1000 years – almost,\\xa0\\nbut not quite forever – there is\\xa0\\xa0 no visible change in the entire universe.\\nAnd then, finally, the last thing to ever\\xa0\\xa0 happen happens. The black dwarf has lost\\xa0\\none too many electrons. It can no longer\\xa0\\xa0 support its immense mass and goes into\\xa0\\nan uncontrolled collapse - a supernova. It first implodes and then explodes\\xa0\\nas bright as a galaxy and fills the\\xa0\\xa0 empty universe with light again! A beautiful\\xa0\\nmoment nobody will get to enjoy. And then,\\xa0\\xa0 as quickly as it began, it's all over. Darkness again, emptiness. That was the last\\xa0thing that will ever happen. \\nThe\\xa0universe may now be truly dead. But don’t be bummed out about it. This is so far\\xa0\\naway in the future that “forever” hardly describes it. Today the universe is the best place it\\xa0\\ncould be for us. And you can sleep tight tonight,\\xa0\\xa0 knowing the last interesting thing that\\xa0\\nwill ever happen is forever long away. For now, there are still plenty of interesting\\xa0\\nthings to discover - and the younger you start\\xa0\\xa0 discovering, the more you will understand\\xa0\\nabout the world we live in. Our sponsor\\xa0\\xa0 KiwiCo helps kids get a headstart there\\n with a\\xa0range of unique crates on a\\xa0\\xa0 myriad of STEM topics, covering science,\\xa0\\ntechnology, engineering, arts and math.

Mh, another day at the Kurzgesagt Labs, where we answer the most important\\nquestions with science. Today: how might civilizations wage war\\nacross light years? What kind of devastating weapons\\ncould they use, and what would they look like? Meet our two players. A yellow dwarf star system\\nhome to a species of primates. \"Humans,\" as they call themselves, recently became\\na technological civilization. They have rockets,\\nnuclear reactors and memes. How cute! The Smorpians disagree. They reside on a planet around\\nthe orange dwarf star HD 40307, 42 light years away. Smorpian civilization\\ndeveloped earlier than humans and they have much better technology. They\\'ve recently built\\na Dyson swarm around their star which gives them near limitless energy. And they noticed humanity, which is unfortunate as the Smorpians\\nare planning a hyperspace bypass through our solar system, so they decided that humanity has to go. Interstellar war is hard though. Front lines, tactics, and logistics\\nare meaningless at these scales. It\\'s also fought across time. Decades will pass\\nbetween firing a weapon and learning whether it hit or not. Sending an invasion fleet is futile. Even if the Smorpians travel\\nin a large fraction of the speed of light, the journey to Earth would take\\ndecades or even centuries, and humans would have\\nplenty of time to prepare. If you want to learn more\\nabout the mind numbing problem of war between alien civilizations, we made a video about it. Today we\\'ll help the Smorpians\\nconstruct a weapon that is not only extremely long range\\nand as fast as physically possible, but that will totally destroy\\neverything on Earth, so no human survivors will come to an act\\nof vengeance on swap in the future. In interstellar war,\\nyou want to win with one shot. Our bird scientists have found\\nthree Smorpian designs: the Star Laser, the Relativistic Missile, and the Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam. All based on real technologies that humans are using\\nin some form already. Let\\'s see how they work. [The Star Laser] As an advanced technological civilization, the Smorpians harness\\nthe energy of their star by surrounding it with billions\\nof solar power satellites. This Dyson swarm collects 1%\\nof the star\\'s energy output, a million billion billion watts, 50 billion times more\\nthan all humanity generates. What if all the power\\nof the Dyson swarm, all those satellites were used\\nto create a star laser? Like any laser, the bigger it is,\\nthe longer its range. Human-built lasers\\nuse small mirrors to focus, so they have short ranges. The Smorpians could turn\\ntheir entire Dyson swarm into a collective focusing element\\na million kilometers wide. The star laser has an insane\\nrange as a result, enough to focus on target Earth from a distance of over\\n2 million light years. OK, let\\'s shoot it. Countless tiny beams combine\\ninto a single huge beam. Laser beams are normally\\ninvisible in space, but the star laser is so powerful that light scattering off bits\\nof dust and gas in its path makes it clearly visible in the sky. A gigantic column of green light. The laser travels at the speed of light, which, oddly enough,\\nis still pretty slow on a galactic level. It takes a whole day until the laser\\nhas left the Smorpian system, shooting into the emptiness between stars. It will travel for decades, occasionally melting the odd bit\\nof interstellar dust or asteroid. 42 years after being fired,\\nit arrives without warning. Humans only notice\\na weird green glow in the sky, and then they\\'re gone. 1% of the energy of a star, concentrated into a beam\\nthe diameter of Earth, traveling 42 light years. It burns the exposed half of the planet with the intensity of 3 million Suns. The seas boil and evaporate,\\nfires scour the land, and within minutes Earth\\'s crust\\nbegins to melt into a sea of lava. As the planet rotates, it turns into a red hot hell\\nwith no trace of life. After a day, it\\'s all over\\nand the laser dies down. In another 42 years, the Smorpians will know\\nif they\\'ve been successful. That\\'s another thing\\nabout interstellar war. When you attack, your grandchildren\\nwill be the ones to find out if you won. It\\'s like all the bombs from World War II\\nexploding in the 80s and us only seeing the effect today. OK, the star laser\\'s extreme range,\\nspeed of light attack, and ability to melt down any target make it a premier interstellar weapon. But is there something else? [The Relativistic Missile] What if instead of converting the energy\\nof their Dyson swarm into a laser, the Smorpians used it\\nto shoot a super bullet? A relativistic missile going as close\\nto the speed of light as possible. This sort of weapon is at the limits of what the Smorpian\\ntechnology can handle, as it requires loads of a highly\\ndangerous material: antimatter. The evil twin of regular matter. Humans have only managed to produce\\na few nanograms of antimatter. With their unlimited energy, Smorpians can manufacture it\\nat an industrial scale to build antimatter rockets. When antimatter and matter are mixed,\\nthey annihilate, which in more practical terms\\nmeans there\\'s a big big boom releasing gamma rays and plasma. The physics is complicated, but basically, if you have\\na really strong magnetic field you can deflect the plasma\\nthrough a nozzle just like in the chemical rockets\\nhumans use. But it would be much, much faster. The fastest rocket possibly basically. Our relativistic missile\\nis much bigger than a skyscraper. At the bottom is the bell shaped\\nmagnetic nozzle 100 meters wide. On top of it are 250 floors\\nfilled with antimatter and matter ready to annihilate each other. On the top floor\\nis a 300 kilogram projectile looking quite small,\\nabout the size of a person. To stop them getting damaged on the way, the missiles have dozens\\nof sacrificial layers that form a Whipple Shield. To make sure they do their job, the Smorpians build 1000 missiles. Let\\'s fire them. Launching all the relativistic missiles\\nis a spectacular event. For a moment, the antimatter engines\\nlighting up outshine their star. Their exhaust is a long trail\\nof brilliant white, and as they accelerate away, they appear redder and redder\\nuntil they turn invisible. With the extreme amount of energy released\\nby the matter-antimatter reactions, the missiles are accelerated to 99.9999996%\\nof the speed of light. They have effectively infinite range, as there\\'s nothing really\\nto slow them down. They arrive shortly\\nafter you can see them. The light from their launch\\nwill take 42 years to reach Earth, so human astronomers might see\\nthe flash of the missile\\'s launch, and then a few days later they\\'ll hit. Not enough time to prepare. Each relativistic missile\\npacks the kinetic energy of a dinosaur killer asteroid, so only one needs to hit. They never reach the ground, disintegrating instead\\nat the edge of Earth\\'s atmosphere. Intense blue flashes\\nset everything on fire. Then continent-sized fireballs\\nslam down on the surface to smash everything into dust, repeatedly, until nothing is left\\nbut rubble and smoke. So interstellar missiles\\nwith unlimited range, minimal warning, and delivering complete\\ndestruction of a planet\\'s surface. Nice. But they are a hassle to build. Is there something else maybe? [The Ultra-Relativistic Electron Beam] Humans do funny things to their food to rid it of bacteria\\nand make it safe to eat, like shooting electron beams\\nat strawberries. Small particle accelerators\\nsend electrons into the food with an energy similar to the radiation\\nfrom nuclear reactions. Not enough to burn the food,\\nbut deadly to bacteria. Smorpians had the same idea,\\nbut bigger. The main challenge\\nwith an electron beam is range. Electrons are negatively\\ncharged particles, so they don\\'t want to stay\\nnear each other. A regular electron beam\\nwill quickly spread out, making it harmless. Smorpians needed to cover distances\\nof dozens of light years, so they\\'ve used the rules\\nof the universe to trick the electrons by building an Ultra-Relativistic\\nElectron Beam, or UREB. What it does is accelerate the electrons to 99.99999… …99999… …99999… …99999… …9999998% of the speed of light. Phew! Faster than even\\nthe most powerful cosmic rays. The closer something travels\\nto the speed of light, the slower time moves for it\\nrelative to the rest of the universe. And since these electrons\\nare moving so incredibly fast, for every second of spreading\\ntheir experience, over 5 million years pass in real time. A physics trick that lets the beam\\ncross interstellar distances while remaining\\ntightly focused on its target. The biggest particle accelerator on Earth\\nis 27 kilometers long. The Smorpians need one\\nthat\\'s over 100,000 kilometers long. A megastructure 8 times longer\\nthan Earth is wide. It\\'s mostly a tube of magnets holding\\nthe beam together until the exit. Like a long trumpet of doom\\nsurrounded by an aura of deadly radiation. When it\\'s fired, it produces a ruler\\nstraight lightning bolt pointed at Earth. Its effects on arrival are less visible\\nthan the other weapons. No flashes of light,\\nno massive firestorms, no explosions. It doesn\\'t destroy rocks,\\nit destroys DNA. People get dizzy, then fall sick\\nas their cells are pierced by radiation. You might think that a deep bunker\\ncould save a few humans, but no. The UREB is so penetrating that its effects accumulate\\nto lethal doses even underground, over days or weeks. In the end, just like our strawberries, Earth becomes sterile. [Simulation results] Hm, another elaborate animated\\nscience explainer by Kurzgesagt where we\\'ve learned a lot,\\nnot sure exactly what. Luckily, the Smorpians don\\'t really exist, but others… might. One major downside of all our weapons is that others around the Milky Way\\ncould see you firing them, which is not ideal because you don\\'t want to present\\nyourself as a dangerous species and tell everybody where exactly you are. So maybe instead of shouting\\nor shooting out into the universe, the best course of action seems to be\\nto stay relatively quiet for now, and observe. Maybe one day we\\'ll witness\\ndistant stars shooting at each other and be glad we stayed out of it.', \"Earth is 4.5 billion years old – impossible\\nfor your brain to truly grasp, so here is an experiment: every second around 1.5 million years \\nwill pass – you're on a musical train ride  looking out the window, passing all of\\nEarth's History in an hour. Watch the eons pass and experience\\nhow long a billion years really is. You can have this in the background, study\\nwith it or just enjoy the ride. From time to time, I’ll say a few words. 4.5 billion years ago, right after it was\\nborn, Earth was a hell of lava… Pretty early in its history, Earth collides\\nwith a Mars sized object called Theia, which forms the moon that you now see in the sky. Right now it looks huge in the night sky and\\nwill slowly shrink over hundreds of millions of years as it orbits further away. 4.5 Billion Years Ago we are in the first eon of our planet, the Hadean, named after the greek god of the underworld. At this point the Atmosphere is mostly CO2\\nand the floor is lava. This area of earth's history is mostly invisible\\nto us because almost none of it is left. 90 million years have passed.  We are still in the lava hell phase. Settle in, this will take a while. Although you wouldn't think it, we found \\nminerals called zircons that indicate there may have been some \\nwater around at this time. During this period of the young solar system,\\nEarth and the inner solar system are smashed by a constant heavy asteroid bombardment,\\nfor several hundred million years. At this point in time, our Sun is 30% less\\nbright than it is today but there are so many greenhouse gases that it's \\nstill much hot and comfy. Around this time we think\\nlife begins to enter the stage. Only a few hundred million years after the\\nbeginning of everything the first cells begin spreading over our still very deadly planet. Earth continues to cool and it probably \\nrains for millions of years as our oceans begin to form, covering \\nthe still young planet with water. These hydrothermal vents we're looking at,\\nand where hot minerals emerge, may have been the place where life first developed, \\nbut we dont know. So much time has passed and we are entering\\nthe Paleoarchean. Most of Earth is still underwater while the\\nfirst supercontinents are in the making in the depths below. Its days are shorter since the \\nyoung Earth spins faster. Good job if you are still watching. You witnessed a billion years so far. From this time in history we still have Stromatolites,\\nsedimentary rocks built by microorganisms. Among our first real evidence of life on Earth. Also life is starting to eat the sun – photosynthesis\\nmight have started as early as around here. 3.2 Billion Years Ago in the Mesoarchean the\\nera of continents begins. Tectonic plates begin to crush into each other,\\npulling and pushing some deep into the earth where they dissolve. The basis for our continents today. The oceans are as hot as a hottub, over 40°C\\nand microbes are expanding everywhere. We don't have plants yet to consume greenhouse\\ngases, so it is really, really hot. You would basically die immediately \\nin this atmosphere. Also there is no oxygen\\nin the atmosphere yet. 2.8 Billion Years Ago the Neoarchean begins. Earth is still a terribly hostile place but\\nbecause we finally have proper plate tectonics, more chemicals are mixed in from inside the\\nearth and life can use them to make new things! Some time around here Prokaryotes like bacteria\\nbegin colonizing the planet. Life diversifies more and more. But still, after so much time, \\nwe only have single cells. 2.5 Billion Years Ago in the Siderian, \\na massive event is about to begin that will change the planet forever:\\nThe Great Oxidation Event. Oxygen, burped out by cyanobacteria reaches\\nthe atmosphere in large quantities, paving the way for more complex life. All the new oxygen in the air reacts with\\nmethane and forms CO2 and Water, which rapidly cools the planet down. Probably for the first time ever, the planet\\nfreezes over and a period of multiple ice ages begins lasting millions of years. 2.3 Billion Years Ago the Rhyacian begins. Lots of volcanos heat up earth and \\nearth unfreezes slowly again. Melting ice flushes toxic elements into the\\noceans but life quietly puts up resistance and keeps evolving. Some time 2.05 Billion Years Ago in the Orosirian\\na large asteroid hits earth and creates the largest verified impact structure on Earth. All over Earth great mountain ranges are \\ncrushed into existence by early continents with wild names like Ur, Nena or Atlantica. 1.8 Billion Years Ago in the Statherian \\nthe supercontinent Columbia has formed. And a natural, self sustaining\\nnuclear reactor awakes, just from scattered uranium\\ndeposits in the ground. 1.6 billion years ago, around the edge of\\nCalimmian, + or - a few hundred million years or so, the first Eukaryotic cells, cells with\\na nucleus, merge from two other cells. One of the most important \\nmoments in the history of life. But yes, kind of looks not that impressive. Still, life is only cells. Earth's crust thickens and heavy continents\\nform, the oceans become shallower. Also the first fungi-like organisms extent\\ntheir tubular arms and do fungi things. Some time in the Ectasian 1.4 Billion Years\\nAgo, Earths inner core is forming. Weird, right? Feels like it should be older. But around here it begins to solidify into\\na iron crystal surrounded by hot liquid metal. It will only grow from now on. 1.2 Billion Years Ago in the Stenian not that\\nmuch is going on. Except, the algae Bangiomorpha \\npubescens might have invented sex. A big reproductive improvement \\nfor many different reasons. 1 Billion Years Ago the Tonian begins, another\\nage where Earth is rocks and puddles and oceans. Life is still invisible to the naked eye. It does feel different to \\nwitness it like that, right? Not everybody is having a great time here. We have evidence of the first unicellular\\npredators emerging around that time. The dominance of bacteria ends and big boy\\neukaryotes plant their flags in the oceans. An arms race between microbes begins that\\nagain creates huge diversity. Some even invent tiny armour. 720 Million Years Ago in the Cryogenian \\nEarth freezes over again. Sure why not. How did life survive? We are not sure. 635 Million Years Ago the supercontinent \\nGondwana forms. A lot of it is still left today! Wow! What's happening? Suddenly life gets big! In a hot second multicellular \\norganisms become widespread! It's all strange aliens still, but can you\\nimagine that it took that long for this to happen? 539 Million Years Ago the \\nCambrian explosion begins. We see life bursting with variety. Ancestors of almost all of today's major animal\\ngroups appear here while the plants start to discover the land. Life is finally exciting! But of course a big mass extinction happens\\nright after, killing most species in the ocean. Plants spread over the planet and create the\\nsoil on the ground and change the atmosphere by eating CO2. Things escalate. Flora and fauna adapt better \\nand better to life on land. We get trees and forrests, fish and the \\nfirst vertebrate decide this land thing is something they need to try out! 359 Million Years Ago in the Carboniferous\\nforests and lush marshlands are at their peak. They will turn into the coal humanity burns\\ntoday to keep ourselves warm. Its all so fast now! Life changes so quickly\\nin geological timeframes! Some 299 Million Years Ago in the Permian,\\nPangea, the last supercontinent has formed. And after a few tens of million years, the\\nlargest mass extinction in history happens, killing the majority of all species. Thanks volcanoes. 252 Million Years Ago the Triassic begins. Oh hey, a dinosaur! We are now truly in the age of reptiles. Dinosaurs are everywhere! The ancestors of the birds do bird things. Life, uhh, finds a way! Earth gets more and more familiar. Such a paradise. Life is thriving. Nothing can go wrong... wait, what's that? And an asteroid killed the dinosaurs and \\nmost species on Earth. Such a bummer. 66 Million Years Ago in the Paleogene the continents look roughly the same as today\\nand mammals take over. It is our time now! We are almost home. Don't blink or you might miss \\nall of human history! And that was it. Earth is ancient. We are new. So new. This was a project born of passion.

But it might have started right after the Big Bang, when\\nthe universe was much stranger and more fantastic than today. A universe that might have allowed\\nlife to develop absolutely anywhere. The cosmos might be full of the seeds of life, sleeping\\nin a dead desert, waiting for a few drops of rain to explosively bloom and grow. Tiny\\nand not so tiny aliens might be everywhere. In this video we are going to put together\\ntwo highly speculative yet scientifically grounded possibilities – check out the scientific\\npapers in our sources. To properly explain it let's first look at the paradox of life\\non Earth. The Life Paradox For its first few hundred million years, Earth\\xa0was a magma hell constantly\\xa0\\nbombarded by asteroids. But basically the second things calmed down\\nand the first oceans formed, life just appeared and zillions of microbes settled every \\nnook and cranny they found. This is kind of strange – life on Earth\\nseems to be almost as old as the planet itself. As if it was waiting around for an opportunity.\\nBut life didn’t only appear extremely quickly: in that tiny time window, \\nit also crossed a huge gap. To qualify as living things, even microbes\\nneed to eat, poop, grow and multiply. To do that, they need a genome,\\xa0\\nthe biological instruction\\xa0manual that sets the inner workings of an organism. How dead things with no genome became living\\nthings with genomes is one of the biggest riddles of science. Simplifying a lot, the\\nproblem is that to have a functioning genome you need proteins, and to make those proteins\\nyou need a functioning genome. Both proteins and genomes are super long molecules \\nmade of pretty complex blocks that are extremely difficult \\nto assemble by\\xa0chance. It is a chicken-egg\\xa0paradox \\nwith several chickens and eggs. Once you have a finished cell, the whole system\\nworks efficiently. But starting from simple dead stuff and reaching\\xa0\\nthat level of sophistication\\xa0 by pure chance should require an amazing amount of time for trial and error. So how did the\\nfirst living things manage to cross that gap in just a few hundred million years? Most theories about the origin of life try\\nto explain that gap by theorizing how some primitive soup of prebiotic molecules could\\xa0have efficiently produced\\xa0\\nthe first self replicating entities. But we still don’t know how exactly\\nthis would have worked. Maybe we need to think backwards. The Clock of Evolution Think of genomes as a book telling the history\\nof life. As time passed and life evolved, more characters were introduced: Amoebae,\\nfish, amphibians, dinosaurs and mammals. Over billions of years, the story \\nof lifegot more and more complex. A genome can be viewed as a long string \\nof letters with biological instructions. And from microbes to us today, functional \\ngenomes seem to have been increasing in size at a fairly constant rate.  The functional genome of fish is more than twice\\nthat of worms; our functional genome is about twice bigger than that of fish and so on.\\nIt is a bit more complicated, but for now let’s run with this. When we put all these clues together,\\nit seems that genomes have been doubling in size on average every 350 million years or\\nso. As if evolution had been following an exponential inner clock. \\nBut it gets even stranger. The very first microbes that emerged on Earth,\\neven if they look simple, already seem to have had pretty long and complex genomes.\\nBut how could life have achieved that level of complexity in such a short time? There may be an interesting way to solve this\\nriddle: We just take our exponential clock and extrapolate it back in time, to the simplest\\nconceivable life form – something equivalent to a being with a genome containing just a\\nfew letters. But if we do that we end up 10 billion years in the past. More than twice\\nthe age of Earth, which means: If life actually evolved like this, it did not start here,\\nbut somewhere out there, in space. This would explain why life started to thrive\\nso quickly on our young planet. If it was already present in space like a seed, it just\\nneeded water and warm temperatures to wake up and go on evolving. And it would also explain\\nthe high degree of sophistication of the first life forms on Earth. They could have been\\ncomplex already because they might have been evolving for billions of years \\nsomewhere else in the universe. But could life really be that old? Maybe yes.\\nActually, life could have started shortly after the universe itself was born. A Goldilocks Baby Universe At its most basic level life needs two things:\\nthe right chemical elements to form complex molecules and a liquid medium like water,\\nin which those molecules can move and interact. The liquid medium needs to stay warm enough\\nto remain, well, liquid. So when we search for life in space, we focus\\non Earth-like planets at just the right distance from their star – warm enough to sustain\\nliquid water. But there was actually a time when almost\\nall of the universe might have been habitable. Right after the Big Bang the universe was\\nextremely hot. But as the cosmos expanded, it cooled. And between about 10 and 17 million\\nyears after the Big Bang, when the universe was a thousand times younger than today, it\\nwas between 100 ºC and 0 ºC – the temperature at which water is liquid. So for this window\\nof time, more than 13.7 billion years ago, the whole universe, absolutely every \\ninch of it, had the right temperature to support life. Of course, the right temperature\\nalone is not enough for life. We also need chemical elements like carbon and oxygen,\\nwhich are forged in the cores of stars. But were there stars in super early cosmic times?\\nMaybe yes – in regions of the universe where matter was especially dense. Such stars\\nwould have been very massive and gone supernova in just 3 million years – seeding the baby\\nuniverse with the chemical elements needed to form dust, asteroids,\\xa0planets\\nand the ingredients\\xa0of life. Maybe the first ancestors of life were more\\nexotic and didn’t even need water, but thrived in substances like ammonia or ethane that\\ncan stay liquid at temperatures far below 0 °C. They could have been sustained by the\\nlingering warmth of the Big Bang for tens of millions of years longer, well into a time\\nwhen we know for sure there were stars and all the chemical elements. The real magic of this idea is that while\\nthe universe today is extremely deadly and hostile, back then the conditions for life\\nmight have been basically everywhere. For a period that may have lasted several dozen\\nmillion years, primordial life might have been able to emerge\\xa0on any rock,\\neven between the stars - sowing the universe with the \\nseeds of what, billions of years later, would become bacteria, \\ntrilobites, dinosaurs, and finally us. At some point the universe cooled below the\\nright temperature for life to thrive, but some of those ancestral life forms may have\\ncontinued to exist in the internal warmth of the first planets, frozen in asteroids\\nor hibernating in cosmic dust – tiny seeds roaming the cosmos waiting for new hospitable\\nplaces to continue evolving. If they did, life now might be everywhere in the universe. Will We Ever Know? All this makes for a nice story. And while \\nboth the habitability of the baby universe  and our exponential clock of life \\nare reasonable ideas – they are still speculative. One more possibility among many others, trying\\nto explain our existence today. But if life came to Earth from outer space,\\nthen it should have seeded other places in the solar system too. Maybe there are fossils\\nin dry riverbeds on Mars. Maybe we’ll soon find life in the warm underground oceans of\\nEnceladus or Europa. Titan has seas, rivers and lakes of ethane and methane as warm as\\nthe universe when it was 90 million years old. So finding exotic life on Titan would\\nsupport the idea that life could have originated in the weird baby universe. So far, when we look out into the cosmos we\\ndon’t see anyone like us. But maybe that's because life needed ten billion years or\\nmore to reach the level of complexity that allows for a technological species. Maybe\\nthere are millions of worlds filled with microbes, oceans full of exotic fish, and continents\\nof bizarre animals. And maybe even others like us, that just recently gained consciousness\\nand are beginning to look at the sky, wondering if they are alone. Life could be flourishing right now in uncountable\\nforms and in all kinds of cosmic environments. And if many of us share a common cosmic origin,\\nwe would all be part of a great cosmic family. The answer may lie in our cosmic backyard.  Let’s go and find out!\", \"Every two years one million Japanese\\xa0\\ndisappear.  China’s population will\\xa0halve by the end of the century, the median\\xa0age in Italy has reached 48.  All around the\\xa0world birth rates are crashing – Is humanity\\xa0\\ndying out? What is going on and how bad is it? For hundreds of thousands of years the human\\xa0\\npopulation barely grew at all, haunted by disease,\\xa0\\xa0 famine and war until the industrial revolution –\\xa0\\nexponential progress led to exponential growth,\\xa0\\xa0 pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the\\xa0\\nyear 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later.\\xa0\\xa0 And our numbers will continue to rise\\xa0\\nfor at least another 60 years – but\\xa0this growth obscures something:\\xa0\\nPeople kinda stopped having babies. For a stable population, every couple needs to\\xa0\\nhave two children on average. If the number is\\xa0higher it grows, if lower, it shrinks. \\nIf it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly: Like in South Korea, one of the hottest \\nexporters\\xa0of pop culture. Its fertility rate lay at 0.8\\xa0children per woman \\nin 2022, the lowest in\\xa0the world. This means 100 South Koreans of\\xa0childbearing \\nage today will have 40 kids. Who\\xa0then will have 16 kids, \\nwho then will have 6.\\xa0\\xa0 If nothing changes then within 100\\xa0years \\nthere will be 94% fewer young people  and South Korea will see a\\xa0population implosion. \\nThat is if things stay the same – we have yet to see\\xa0if there is a \\nbottom to fertility rates. Although looking at the bigger picture and\\xa0absolute \\nnumbers, this population will not shrink that much – it simply returns to the level it once\\xa0was. \\nIn 1950 there were 20 million South Koreans,\\xa0\\xa0 in 2023 there are 52 million. And by 2100 there\\xa0\\nwill be 24 million again. But the issue is not\\xa0that there \\nwill be fewer South Koreans,  the\\xa0issue is the composition of the population. In\\xa01950 the median age was 18. In 2023 it is 45.\\xa0\\nIn 2100 it will be 59. A country of seniors. And South Korea is far from alone. China may be seeing the steepest population\\xa0\\nreversal in history, unstoppable at this point. Rapid industrialization, urbanisation and\\xa0\\nrising incomes meant that the Chinese started to\\xa0\\xa0 prefer smaller families. That, plus the\\xa0\\nintroduction of the One Child Policy,\\xa0\\xa0 which aimed to slow population growth, means that\\xa0\\nChina has had a low fertility rate for decades. With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman,\\xa0\\xa0 within four generations 100\\xa0young \\nChinese will turn into 20.\\xa0\\xa0 China's fertility rates are now one of the\\xa0\\nlowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's. In comparison Europe’s depopulation\\xa0\\nis much slower despite low fertility,\\xa0\\xa0 since unlike Asia most states have had a steady\\xa0\\nflow of immigrants. The impact is complex,\\xa0\\xa0 as a good chunk of immigrants come\\xa0\\nfrom other low fertility rate areas,\\xa0\\xa0 the number of immigrant women who do have a lot of\\xa0\\nchildren is not yet high enough to make a big dent\\xa0\\xa0 and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust\\xa0\\nto the native population within 2-3 generations. In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even\\xa0\\nmore because many young people have emigrated to\\xa0\\xa0 stronger economies, like Germany – whose median\\xa0\\nage is one of the highest in the world at 46. Latin America fell below\\xa0\\nreplacement in 2015. In the US,\\xa0\\xa0 immigration is the only thing keeping\\xa0\\nthe population growing substantially. There are still places where fertility\\xa0\\nrates have not fallen below replacement yet:\\xa0\\xa0 In much of the Middle East, North and Sub\\xa0\\nSaharan Africa fertility is still high,\\xa0\\xa0 which creates the same concerns\\xa0\\nabout overpopulation as when\\xa0\\xa0 Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s,\\xa0\\nbut that turned out to be unfounded. But recently the UN has reduced its forecast\\xa0\\nfor Africa’s population drastically. For Nigeria\\xa0\\xa0 estimates were lowered from 733 million\\xa0\\nto 546 million by 2100. Similar trends are\\xa0\\xa0 being noted across the continent. As Africa\\xa0\\ndevelops, fertility rates are shrinking much\\xa0\\xa0 faster than anticipated. It is becoming\\xa0\\nmore likely that East Asia’s story will\\xa0\\xa0 repeat itself – by the end of the century most\\xa0\\nplaces in Africa may be below replacement too. So declining fertility rates\\xa0\\nand ageing populations have\\xa0\\xa0 become a general trend, all over the world. Why is all of this a big deal? Demographics & Poverty For a functioning society you need enough\\xa0\\npeople in the prime of their lives. Young\\xa0and middle aged people do most of\\xa0\\nthe work. In any economic system,\\xa0\\xa0 working age people create a society’s wealth. In retirement you stop contributing as\\xa0\\nmuch to the economy. But the majority of\\xa0\\xa0 healthcare costs are generated by\\xa0\\nseniors. The way the world worked\\xa0\\xa0 in the past was that a lot of younger\\xa0\\npeople took care of a few older people. Imagine a society where most people are\\xa0\\nolder than 60. The financial burden for\\xa0\\xa0 the young will be immense, unsustainable\\xa0\\neven for the richest countries. Even\\xa0in the best case this will mean\\xa0\\npeople having to work way longer,\\xa0\\xa0 exploding health care costs and poverty, while\\xa0\\nstates with shrinking income struggle to keep up\\xa0\\xa0 with rising costs. Technology might soften\\xa0\\nthe blow, but can’t compensate entirely. We can see this happening already – 11 out of\\xa0\\n31 provinces in China are running deficits for\\xa0\\xa0 their pension funds. They got old before\\xa0\\nthey got rich and now they can’t really\\xa0\\xa0 catch up anymore. China’s working age\\xa0\\npopulation is predicted to fall by 20%,\\xa0\\xa0 or 200 million people by 2050 – as much as\\xa0\\ntoday’s entire working age population of the US. Infrastructure collapse is an almost\\xa0\\nuniversal constant of population decline.\\xa0 Because infrastructure works at scale and\\xa0\\ndoesn’t get cheaper to operate if it is used\\xa0\\xa0 by fewer people. If a population declines,\\xa0\\nbe it because of urbanisation or the loss\\xa0\\xa0 of industry and employment – once people and\\xa0\\ntheir income disappear, the resources necessary\\xa0\\xa0 to sustain infrastructure disappear too.\\nYou can see it in many depopulated towns\\xa0\\xa0 and cities in East Germany that suffered\\xa0\\nsharp population decline after German\\xa0\\xa0 reunification. Or look at Japan. You can\\xa0\\ntour the countryside to see dying towns. Wait – if there are fewer people, won’t life get\\xa0\\ncheaper and better and there’ll be more resources\\xa0\\xa0 to go around? Well no – population decline\\xa0\\ndoesn't lead to prosperity. It’s people’s\\xa0\\xa0 ideas and work that create our prosperity,\\xa0\\nnot the mere availability of resources. Another danger for ageing societies is that\\xa0\\nelected governments could decide to mostly\\xa0\\xa0 represent the interests and fears of their\\xa0\\nelderly populations – potentially leading\\xa0\\xa0 to short term thinking and a preference\\xa0\\nfor conserving wealth over innovation.\\xa0\\xa0 That's not a society that can handle\\xa0\\nissues like climate change, which need\\xa0\\xa0 massive investment and fresh ideas – something\\xa0\\nthe world is already having a hard time with. Many people think that having fewer humans on earth is\\xa0\\nactually a good thing because our societies are\\xa0\\xa0 too unsustainable, we are using up too many\\xa0\\nresources and because of climate change. The problem is, that even if you want fewer\\nhumans, this process is very likely too slow\\xa0\\xa0 to have a positive impact on the environment – the\\xa0\\nworld population is going to grow for at least 60\\xa0\\xa0 more years before it may shrink again – by then we\\xa0\\nhave to solve climate change. Likewise, any other\\xa0\\xa0 upsides a lower population might have will most\\xa0\\nlikely not materialise themselves this century. So Just Like \\nImport People? The easiest solution seems to be immigration,\\xa0\\nbut the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local\\xa0\\xa0 levels within three generations. So you need\\xa0\\na constant influx of new migrants – which is\\xa0\\xa0 not sustainable long term as birth rates are\\xa0\\ndropping everywhere. The only way would be\\xa0\\xa0 to keep poor countries poor, so that the young\\xa0\\nand motivated migrate to developed countries,\\xa0\\xa0 looking for opportunity and a better life.\\xa0\\nKind of an immoral thing to wish for. By the end of the century Africa will have\\xa0\\nthe highest number of young people in the\\xa0\\xa0 world and so African migrants might become\\xa0\\nthe world's most sought after immigrants,\\xa0\\xa0 with elderly nations fighting hard for\\xa0\\nevery person willing to make the move. Immigration also can create societal or cultural\\xa0\\ntensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all\\xa0\\xa0 cultures – especially when cultures with very\\xa0\\ndifferent sets of values meet – often leading\\xa0\\xa0 to a backlash that slows immigration down\\xa0\\nagain. It’s easy to be frustrated at this,\\xa0\\xa0 but ignoring this will only divide societies,\\xa0\\nempower demagogues and increase xenophobia. Economically, immigration is\\xa0\\nlargely beneficial for societies,\\xa0\\xa0 even if this seems counterintuitive to many\\xa0\\npeople. Especially countries like the US,\\xa0\\xa0 an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal\\xa0\\nfreedom and opportunity through hard work,\\xa0\\xa0 will benefit the most. Countries like this\\xa0\\nwill have a clear advantage this century,\\xa0\\xa0 especially if they can attract the\\xa0\\nworld’s brightest and most ambitious. Conclusion & Our Opinion This topic is way too big, affects\\xa0\\nsocieties as diverse as literally\\xa0\\xa0 all of humanity. So please take this\\xa0\\npart with a gigantic grain of salt,\\xa0\\xa0 obviously we are looking at this from\\xa0\\nour central European perspective. One way to look at falling birthrates is\\xa0\\nas a side effect of the world being less\\xa0\\xa0 bad than it was. Especially women are\\nfreer, more educated and wealthier than in the past.\\xa0\\xa0 But it turns out that if societies are better\\xa0\\noff, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.\\xa0 Interestingly, there is a gap between how many\\xa0\\nkids people want and how many they are having: The\\xa0mean number of kids women in Europe want is \\naround\\xa02.3, much more than they are actually having. While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last\\xa0\\ncentury, across continents and economic systems,\\xa0\\xa0 that came at a cost: The tight knit\\xa0\\ncommunities and family structures\\xa0\\xa0 that were part of our nature, where\\xa0\\nkids could be brought up by a village. Today young parents have to deal with\\xa0\\ndifferent challenges and societal expectations. Women are kind of ground down between the wish\\xa0\\nand expectation to have a family and a career,\\xa0\\xa0 being pressured to do both but not\\xa0\\ncompromise either. Men are sharing\\xa0\\xa0 parental duties more equally than they used to,\\xa0\\nbut are often still expected to be the provider. And it is sadly true that usually, at least one\\xa0\\nparent's career is held back.

China’s population will\\xa0halve by the end of the century, the median\\xa0age in Italy has reached 48.  All around the\\xa0world birth rates are crashing – Is humanity\\xa0\\ndying out? What is going on and how bad is it? For hundreds of thousands of years the human\\xa0\\npopulation barely grew at all, haunted by disease,\\xa0\\xa0 famine and war until the industrial revolution –\\xa0\\nexponential progress led to exponential growth,\\xa0\\xa0 pushing our numbers to 6 billion in the\\xa0\\nyear 1999 and 8 billion just 24 years later.\\xa0\\xa0 And our numbers will continue to rise\\xa0\\nfor at least another 60 years – but\\xa0this growth obscures something:\\xa0\\nPeople kinda stopped having babies. For a stable population, every couple needs to\\xa0\\nhave two children on average. If the number is\\xa0higher it grows, if lower, it shrinks. \\nIf it's well below, it shrinks a lot, and quickly: Like in South Korea, one of the hottest \\nexporters\\xa0of pop culture. Its fertility rate lay at 0.8\\xa0children per woman \\nin 2022, the lowest in\\xa0the world. This means 100 South Koreans of\\xa0childbearing \\nage today will have 40 kids. Who\\xa0then will have 16 kids, \\nwho then will have 6.\\xa0\\xa0 If nothing changes then within 100\\xa0years \\nthere will be 94% fewer young people  and South Korea will see a\\xa0population implosion. \\nThat is if things stay the same – we have yet to see\\xa0if there is a \\nbottom to fertility rates. Although looking at the bigger picture and\\xa0absolute \\nnumbers, this population will not shrink that much – it simply returns to the level it once\\xa0was. \\nIn 1950 there were 20 million South Koreans,\\xa0\\xa0 in 2023 there are 52 million. And by 2100 there\\xa0\\nwill be 24 million again. But the issue is not\\xa0that there \\nwill be fewer South Koreans,  the\\xa0issue is the composition of the population. In\\xa01950 the median age was 18. In 2023 it is 45.\\xa0\\nIn 2100 it will be 59. A country of seniors. And South Korea is far from alone. China may be seeing the steepest population\\xa0\\nreversal in history, unstoppable at this point. Rapid industrialization, urbanisation and\\xa0\\nrising incomes meant that the Chinese started to\\xa0\\xa0 prefer smaller families. That, plus the\\xa0\\nintroduction of the One Child Policy,\\xa0\\xa0 which aimed to slow population growth, means that\\xa0\\nChina has had a low fertility rate for decades. With a fertility rate of 1.16 births per woman,\\xa0\\xa0 within four generations 100\\xa0young \\nChinese will turn into 20.\\xa0\\xa0 China's fertility rates are now one of the\\xa0\\nlowest in East Asia, lower than even Japan's. In comparison Europe’s depopulation\\xa0\\nis much slower despite low fertility,\\xa0\\xa0 since unlike Asia most states have had a steady\\xa0\\nflow of immigrants. The impact is complex,\\xa0\\xa0 as a good chunk of immigrants come\\xa0\\nfrom other low fertility rate areas,\\xa0\\xa0 the number of immigrant women who do have a lot of\\xa0\\nchildren is not yet high enough to make a big dent\\xa0\\xa0 and fertility rates of immigrants tend to adjust\\xa0\\nto the native population within 2-3 generations. In Eastern Europe, the decline has sped up even\\xa0\\nmore because many young people have emigrated to\\xa0\\xa0 stronger economies, like Germany – whose median\\xa0\\nage is one of the highest in the world at 46. Latin America fell below\\xa0\\nreplacement in 2015. In the US,\\xa0\\xa0 immigration is the only thing keeping\\xa0\\nthe population growing substantially. There are still places where fertility\\xa0\\nrates have not fallen below replacement yet:\\xa0\\xa0 In much of the Middle East, North and Sub\\xa0\\nSaharan Africa fertility is still high,\\xa0\\xa0 which creates the same concerns\\xa0\\nabout overpopulation as when\\xa0\\xa0 Asia grew very quickly in the 1950s,\\xa0\\nbut that turned out to be unfounded. But recently the UN has reduced its forecast\\xa0\\nfor Africa’s population drastically. For Nigeria\\xa0\\xa0 estimates were lowered from 733 million\\xa0\\nto 546 million by 2100. Similar trends are\\xa0\\xa0 being noted across the continent. As Africa\\xa0\\ndevelops, fertility rates are shrinking much\\xa0\\xa0 faster than anticipated. It is becoming\\xa0\\nmore likely that East Asia’s story will\\xa0\\xa0 repeat itself – by the end of the century most\\xa0\\nplaces in Africa may be below replacement too. So declining fertility rates\\xa0\\nand ageing populations have\\xa0\\xa0 become a general trend, all over the world. Why is all of this a big deal? Demographics & Poverty For a functioning society you need enough\\xa0\\npeople in the prime of their lives. Young\\xa0and middle aged people do most of\\xa0\\nthe work. In any economic system,\\xa0\\xa0 working age people create a society’s wealth. In retirement you stop contributing as\\xa0\\nmuch to the economy. But the majority of\\xa0\\xa0 healthcare costs are generated by\\xa0\\nseniors. The way the world worked\\xa0\\xa0 in the past was that a lot of younger\\xa0\\npeople took care of a few older people. Imagine a society where most people are\\xa0\\nolder than 60. The financial burden for\\xa0\\xa0 the young will be immense, unsustainable\\xa0\\neven for the richest countries. Even\\xa0in the best case this will mean\\xa0\\npeople having to work way longer,\\xa0\\xa0 exploding health care costs and poverty, while\\xa0\\nstates with shrinking income struggle to keep up\\xa0\\xa0 with rising costs. Technology might soften\\xa0\\nthe blow, but can’t compensate entirely. We can see this happening already – 11 out of\\xa0\\n31 provinces in China are running deficits for\\xa0\\xa0 their pension funds. They got old before\\xa0\\nthey got rich and now they can’t really\\xa0\\xa0 catch up anymore. China’s working age\\xa0\\npopulation is predicted to fall by 20%,\\xa0\\xa0 or 200 million people by 2050 – as much as\\xa0\\ntoday’s entire working age population of the US. Infrastructure collapse is an almost\\xa0\\nuniversal constant of population decline.\\xa0 Because infrastructure works at scale and\\xa0\\ndoesn’t get cheaper to operate if it is used\\xa0\\xa0 by fewer people. If a population declines,\\xa0\\nbe it because of urbanisation or the loss\\xa0\\xa0 of industry and employment – once people and\\xa0\\ntheir income disappear, the resources necessary\\xa0\\xa0 to sustain infrastructure disappear too.\\nYou can see it in many depopulated towns\\xa0\\xa0 and cities in East Germany that suffered\\xa0\\nsharp population decline after German\\xa0\\xa0 reunification. Or look at Japan. You can\\xa0\\ntour the countryside to see dying towns. Wait – if there are fewer people, won’t life get\\xa0\\ncheaper and better and there’ll be more resources\\xa0\\xa0 to go around? Well no – population decline\\xa0\\ndoesn't lead to prosperity. It’s people’s\\xa0\\xa0 ideas and work that create our prosperity,\\xa0\\nnot the mere availability of resources. Another danger for ageing societies is that\\xa0\\nelected governments could decide to mostly\\xa0\\xa0 represent the interests and fears of their\\xa0\\nelderly populations – potentially leading\\xa0\\xa0 to short term thinking and a preference\\xa0\\nfor conserving wealth over innovation.\\xa0\\xa0 That's not a society that can handle\\xa0\\nissues like climate change, which need\\xa0\\xa0 massive investment and fresh ideas – something\\xa0\\nthe world is already having a hard time with. Many people think that having fewer humans on earth is\\xa0\\nactually a good thing because our societies are\\xa0\\xa0 too unsustainable, we are using up too many\\xa0\\nresources and because of climate change. The problem is, that even if you want fewer\\nhumans, this process is very likely too slow\\xa0\\xa0 to have a positive impact on the environment – the\\xa0\\nworld population is going to grow for at least 60\\xa0\\xa0 more years before it may shrink again – by then we\\xa0\\nhave to solve climate change. Likewise, any other\\xa0\\xa0 upsides a lower population might have will most\\xa0\\nlikely not materialise themselves this century. So Just Like \\nImport People? The easiest solution seems to be immigration,\\xa0\\nbut the fertility of immigrants adjusts to local\\xa0\\xa0 levels within three generations. So you need\\xa0\\na constant influx of new migrants – which is\\xa0\\xa0 not sustainable long term as birth rates are\\xa0\\ndropping everywhere. The only way would be\\xa0\\xa0 to keep poor countries poor, so that the young\\xa0\\nand motivated migrate to developed countries,\\xa0\\xa0 looking for opportunity and a better life.\\xa0\\nKind of an immoral thing to wish for. By the end of the century Africa will have\\xa0\\nthe highest number of young people in the\\xa0\\xa0 world and so African migrants might become\\xa0\\nthe world's most sought after immigrants,\\xa0\\xa0 with elderly nations fighting hard for\\xa0\\nevery person willing to make the move. Immigration also can create societal or cultural\\xa0\\ntensions, which is a universal phenomenon in all\\xa0\\xa0 cultures – especially when cultures with very\\xa0\\ndifferent sets of values meet – often leading\\xa0\\xa0 to a backlash that slows immigration down\\xa0\\nagain. It’s easy to be frustrated at this,\\xa0\\xa0 but ignoring this will only divide societies,\\xa0\\nempower demagogues and increase xenophobia. Economically, immigration is\\xa0\\nlargely beneficial for societies,\\xa0\\xa0 even if this seems counterintuitive to many\\xa0\\npeople. Especially countries like the US,\\xa0\\xa0 an immigrant nation built on the idea of personal\\xa0\\nfreedom and opportunity through hard work,\\xa0\\xa0 will benefit the most. Countries like this\\xa0\\nwill have a clear advantage this century,\\xa0\\xa0 especially if they can attract the\\xa0\\nworld’s brightest and most ambitious. Conclusion & Our Opinion This topic is way too big, affects\\xa0\\nsocieties as diverse as literally\\xa0\\xa0 all of humanity. So please take this\\xa0\\npart with a gigantic grain of salt,\\xa0\\xa0 obviously we are looking at this from\\xa0\\nour central European perspective. One way to look at falling birthrates is\\xa0\\nas a side effect of the world being less\\xa0\\xa0 bad than it was. Especially women are\\nfreer, more educated and wealthier than in the past.\\xa0\\xa0 But it turns out that if societies are better\\xa0\\noff, individuals often decide to have fewer kids.\\xa0 Interestingly, there is a gap between how many\\xa0\\nkids people want and how many they are having: The\\xa0mean number of kids women in Europe want is \\naround\\xa02.3, much more than they are actually having. While we gained a lot of freedoms in the last\\xa0\\ncentury, across continents and economic systems,\\xa0\\xa0 that came at a cost: The tight knit\\xa0\\ncommunities and family structures\\xa0\\xa0 that were part of our nature, where\\xa0\\nkids could be brought up by a village. Today young parents have to deal with\\xa0\\ndifferent challenges and societal expectations. Women are kind of ground down between the wish\\xa0\\nand expectation to have a family and a career,\\xa0\\xa0 being pressured to do both but not\\xa0\\ncompromise either. Men are sharing\\xa0\\xa0 parental duties more equally than they used to,\\xa0\\nbut are often still expected to be the provider. And it is sadly true that usually, at least one\\xa0\\nparent's career is held back. In many developed\\xa0\\xa0 countries the gender pay gap is chiefly a\\xa0\\npay gap between mothers and everyone else. But it is not just outside pressure: Our\\xa0\\nculture of individualism probably plays a\\xa0\\xa0 role too.

As far as you know, you are real and exist in\\na universe that was born 14 billion years ago and that gave rise to galaxies, stars,\\nthe Earth, and finally you.  Except, maybe not. You may actually not exist for real but be the dream of a dead universe \\n– you and everything you think exists. Crazy as it sounds, this may be an unavoidable consequence of our best scientific theories about the universe. Ok, this is a bit much – let’s start at the beginning. We need to understand three concepts\\nfor this idea to make sense! 1. The Arrow of Time What distinguishes the past from the future?\\nPut a drop of red ink into a glass of water and you see the ink spread until it fills\\nthe container but never the opposite: colored water where ink spontaneously concentrates\\nand becomes a drop at the surface again. Time always seems to flow in the direction\\nin which the ink spreads. But if you take a microscope, all you see\\nwill be a swarm of molecules colliding at random  – there are no rules, no forwards and backwards. Every individual motion that happens can occur in reverse. But we perceive a sort of arrow of time \\nthat makes things happen in one direction – how does this phenomenon occur? Well, this arrow of time is not actually fundamental,\\nbut a matter of probability. When ink molecules spread to fill a glass, there are many different “slots” of space they can occupy, and therefore many different possibilities to combine them. And just like your chances of winning the lottery grow \\nthe more tickets you have,  the probability that ink molecules will end up \\nfilling the glass is much higher than the probability that they\\'ll concentrate in just one spot. So it is not that the ink forming a drop again is forbidden by the laws of physics, it\\'s\\njust extremely unlikely. To see it you’d have to wait about 10 to the power of 100,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 years – a 1 followed by one hundred sextillion zeros.\\nIf you had this much time to spare, eventually by pure random chance, you’d see a red blob\\nform again. Actually, with enough time, you could see any shape forming. Like, for example,\\na small, red, soggy brain. Ok, let’s move on to idea 2. 2. The far future of the universe Our universe was born 14 billion years ago\\nin the Big Bang, it expanded and evolved to give rise to the myriads of galaxies and things.\\nIn other words, the universe is kind of a glass of water with a lot of ink doing\\nstuff – it has an arrow of time. But the universe is not a static glass, it\\nseems to be getting bigger at an ever increasing speed because of dark energy. Basically, everything\\nin it is getting more and more diluted. In about 100 trillion years, the last star will\\ndie. Then few interesting things will happen for the next few decillions, vigintillions\\nand googols of years. Eventually the universe will be a dark place \\nfully dominated by dark energy – a rapidly expanding ball of pure space \\nalmost devoid of matter. You might think that this would lead to the \\nultimate death of everything  but dark energy\\nhas one last surprise for you. In a universe dominated by dark energy, space\\nexpands so dramatically that it creates a \"cosmic horizon\" around you: a border beyond which nothing will ever \\nbe able to reach you, not even light.  So for every practical purpose,\\nthe universe has become a glass of finite size about 36 billion light-years wide, surrounded\\nby an impassable cosmic horizon. Such a universe glass is basically a giant black hole \\nturned inside out. We know that, due to quantum effects, all\\nblack holes emit a tiny amount of particles – a phenomenon known as \"Hawking radiation\".\\nAnd so does our inside out black hole. In the end, this radiation will fill the universe\\nglass with particles again. At this point, so far in the future that giving you a number\\nhas no more meaning, we\\'ve reached the true final state.\\nThe universe has now become a closed box full of particles at an extremely low but finite\\ntemperature. And since they have a temperature, they undergo random motions. Or in other words:\\na glass filled with water and ink and an infinite amount of time ahead.\\nThings are about to become interesting again. 3. Typing Monkeys & Fake Universes Eternity is a long, long time. So now even the most extremely unlikely things can happen. The fluctuating particles are bumping into each other \\nover and over and over again creating every combination of particles that\\'s possible. They\\'re like a monkey typing at random on a typewriter. Almost all of the time it types gibberish. But with enough time, eventually\\nit will write the first acts of Hamlet. And with even more time, the complete works of\\nEminem. If ink in our universe glass generates any\\nrandom arrangements of particles, what could they be? Well, a spontaneous fluctuation could give rise to a planet. Or to a galaxy. Or even\\nto a lot of them. So maybe our universe has already ended and all we see around us is\\na “pop-up universe” – not a universe that evolved from a Big Bang, but one that\\nfluctuated into existence by pure chance. And that, like the drop of ink, will only\\nexist for a while before dissolving again. Being random, pop-up universes could be similar\\nto ours but with funny glitches. In some of these universes dinosaurs are riding snails.\\nIn another, stars are made of blueberries. In another you are wearing a funny hat.\\nScientists in such universes wouldn\\'t understand those glitches, so maybe the greatest mysteries\\nof physics are just nonsense bugs of our pop-up universe.\\nBut not all possible fluctuations of our dead universe have the same probability of occurring.\\nSmaller fluctuations are much more probable than bigger ones. A planet is more likely\\nthan a galaxy. But you know what is even way more likely? \\nA human brain. Are you actually just a brain? You think, therefore you exist. \\nBut what else do you truly know?  In the end, your brain is just interpreting \\nsignals from your senses and creating a world that you experience. So technically, you could be just your brain\\nthat thinks the world is real. And if we follow the logic of the ink in the universe glass,\\nin particular, you could be a disembodied brain that, just by chance, emerged in a dead\\nuniverse with your complete set of knowledge and memories.\\nThis is a pretty bizarre idea but if we do the math, it is kind of pretty solid. Let’s\\ncompare the number of brains inside bodies in a living universe with the number of naked\\nbrains in a dead universe. Let’s go really big and imagine that a total\\nof 100 quadrillion humans will live around Earth. And that the same amount of people\\nwill live around every star in the universe. If we add this together we get about 10 to the power of 41\\nbrains inside bodies that will exist. However, in a dead universe that has had enough\\ntime to explore all possible fluctuations and that will exist forever, the number of\\nnaked brains that would emerge is well… infinite.\\nSo the probability that you are a floating brain is not only vastly larger than the probability\\nthat you are a real human. It is so inconceivably larger that we can’t even meaningfully quantify\\nthe difference. How do you compare a number to infinity?\\nSo… are you a floating brain that exists for one moment in time, then basically forever\\npasses and then you exist for another moment in time? Maybe not even in that order? Maybe\\nyour life happens backwards and you just don\\'t notice? Maybe you have lived trillions of times already. Are you the dream of a dead universe? Really? Like, really? Well, probably not. First of all, there are\\na few loopholes. For example, dark energy could behave completely differently from what\\nwe think today and lead us to another future. Or maybe our dead universe will be too motionless\\nto allow the creation of brains, even with infinite time... Or maybe the universe will\\nend up dying in another way. Our understanding of the cosmos doesn\\'t have a solid enough\\nfoundation for anyone to worry if they are real or not.\\nLoopholes aside, if you were a fluctuating brain, all the laws of physics stored in your\\nbrain would have originated at random and shouldn’t bear any relation to the real\\nworld. But we just used those laws to prove that you are a floating brain! So even if\\nyou believe that you are a floating brain, you’d have to admit that you have no good\\nreason to believe that you are actually a floating brain.\\nOk. So this hallucinatory trip might teach us something about our theories about the\\nuniverse. But in the end it is just a really weird exercise in what you can do with physics.\\nAn exercise of what brains in bodies are able to think about. So don’t worry – you are not a dream of the dead universe. Probably.

Here is what we know: Four minutes ago\\xa0\\nour new infrared monitoring satellites detected\\xa0one hundred twelve bursts consistent with\\xa0\\nICBM launches from the enemy’s inner territories.\\xa0\\xa0 For some reason only 20 of their 80 underground\\xa0\\nnuclear silos seem to have fired, so we suspect\\xa0\\xa0 most of them were transporter-erector launchers,\\xa0\\nyou know: trucks with big missiles on them. It’s\\xa0unclear why they didn’t\\xa0\\nuse all their silos – they\\xa0\\xa0 might just not work after more than thirty\\xa0years or they might be keeping them in reserve. The\\xa0\\nfog of war is keeping many things unclear! Aerospace Command thinks the ICBMs are\\xa0\\ntargeting our nuclear command centers,\\xa0\\xa0 silos, and major airforce and navy bases,\\xa0\\nending this war before we have a chance to\\xa0act! The enemy’s strategic doctrine prioritizes\\xa0\\nmilitary targets and our nuclear weapon\\xa0\\xa0 systems, but their secondary targets are our\\xa0\\nindustry and infrastructure – oil refineries,\\xa0\\xa0 power stations and deep water ports. All\\xa0\\nlocated near or in major population centers. We won’t know the exact\\xa0\\ncasualty count for a few weeks. Deaths from the blast\\xa0and burns\\xa0\\nmay be a few million today. It’s\\xa0morning rush hour and there’s not much\\xa0\\nto be done for people stuck in traffic. People\\xa0in major metro areas can’t really\\xa0\\nevacuate, but emergency broadcasts are\\xa0\\xa0 being sent out to shelter in place and away\\xa0\\nfrom windows. Radiation exposure for intact\\xa0\\xa0 population centers is highly dependent\\xa0\\non the weather\\xa0over the next week. We might be looking at dozens of millions\\xa0\\nof deaths by the end of the month. For the next few minutes we can\\xa0\\xa0 still\\xa0respond, but –\\nYou need to decide! We’ve got 1500 warheads across our\\xa0\\nsilos, bombers, and submarines. The 400 in silos\\xa0need to be launched now\\nbefore they\\xa0get taken out. 46 nuclear capable bombers\\xa0on high alert\\ncan be ready to take off in 2\\xa0minutes – though we need to transmit the order now\\nto get them out of the blast radius if\\xa0you want to consider using them. Of our 14 nuclear submarines,\\xa0\\n5 are presently at\\xa0sea. While they’re submerged they’re\\xa0\\nundetectable, so that’s our\\xa0\\xa0 back-up for a nuclear retaliation\\nif we lose our silos and bombers. We could try to use them\\xa0\\nto bomb out their remaining\\xa0 silo fields\\xa0before they can launch them. The sooner you commit\\xa0to it,\\xa0\\nthe better the chance we have of preventing\\xa0a further\\xa0\\nexchange after our retaliation. Updates! We have radar confirmation that the enemy\\xa0ICBMs\\xa0 have completed their burn\\xa0\\nand deployed\\xa0their warheads. Our best guess is that each missile will\\xa0\\ndeploy at least 6 re-entry vehicles,\\xa0\\xa0 about 600 in total, which is the part that\\xa0\\ncarries a warhead back into the atmosphere\\xa0\\xa0 during its terminal descent onto the target\\xa0\\n– and with many more decoys on top of that, inflatable\\xa0balloons meant\\xa0\\nto waste any anti-missiles.\\xa0 We’re\\xa0now tracking nearly 4000 potential targets. Our anti-ballistic missiles have been launched\\xa0\\nand will begin their intercept in another minute. We’ll do our best to protect the capital,\\nalthough there really is no defense. Wait… confirming a partial radar\\xa0\\nblackout, our systems seem to be glitchy. The enemy must have\\xa0anticipated we’d launch our\\xa0\\xa0 interceptors and pre-detonated\\xa0\\na few warheads at high\\xa0altitude. That ionizes the atmosphere\\xa0\\nand creates\\xa0radar interference. Our interceptors\\xa0should still operate okay,\\xa0\\xa0 they’ve had a 55% success rate in\\xa0\\ntests but never with this many\\xa0decoys or with radar interference this\\xa0intense.\\nWe might shoot down 50 objects,\\xa0\\xa0 but there’s no guarantee they’re warheads.\\nIt\\xa0looks like most bombs are going to get through. This is our last chance to counterattack.\\xa0\\nWe’re out of time. Our silo launch\\xa0\\xa0 sequence takes 5 minutes. We have to\\xa0\\ntransmit and confirm a launch order and the\\xa0missile needs time to clear\\xa0\\nthe blast radius of the incoming bomb. This is a lot to take in,\\xa0\\nbut the war\\xa0plan is made,\\xa0 you just need to enter\\xa0the\\xa0\\nlaunch authorization codes and push\\xa0this button to transmit them! You can’t\\xa0do anything else\\xa0\\nto save more of\\xa0our people. If you don’t launch now then\\xa0this war will be\\xa0 over before it even begins –\\nyou understand this is our one chance, right? The effect? Enemy civilian casualties are hard\\xa0\\nto estimate, but should be similar to ours – a\\xa0few million right away, perhaps a few\\xa0\\ntens of million by the end of the\\xa0month. The total fallout from their attacks\\xa0\\nand ours might trigger a nuclear winter,\\xa0\\xa0 potentially killing billions around the world –\\xa0\\nbut that might happen even if we don’t retaliate. I’m sure you have questions but\\xa0you have\\xa0 to give orders without\\xa0expecting\\xa0\\nanswers right now. With\\xa0an attack of this scale there’s no\\xa0guarantee communications or assets\\xa0will\\xa0\\nbe intact in a few minutes. We’re out of time, we need a\\xa0\\ndecision Sir. Can we launch? Nuclear wars aren’t regular wars. They\\xa0\\nonly last minutes, and in times of crisis,\\xa0\\xa0 small conflicts can rapidly spiral out of\\xa0\\ncontrol. Anything from small communication\\xa0lags to sensor errors to just uncertainty and the\\xa0\\nfog of war mean that no leader will ever have a complete idea of what’s happening as a crisis\\xa0\\nunfolds. When tensions are high, accidents or\\xa0\\xa0 misunderstandings can steer leaders - even those\\xa0\\nwith good intentions - to launch a nuclear attack.\\xa0\\xa0 Confused and with incomplete\\xa0\\ninformation,\\xa0a single person – yes, it's really just ONE\\xa0\\nsingle person who decides – can literally\\xa0make civilization-ending decisions killing\\xa0hundreds of millions of people in\\xa0\\nthe time it takes to watch a YouTube video. This story is fiction, but the world\\xa0\\ncame very close to this several times. In 1995 Russian radar detected a submarine\\xa0\\nlaunched missile and their nuclear forces went\\xa0\\xa0 on full alert, except it was actually\\xa0\\na scientific rocket to study auroras. In 1979,\\xa0US computers reported a full scale\\xa0\\nSoviet attack with only minutes to\\xa0respond\\xa0 – except it was a training tape being\\xa0\\nincorrectly loaded into a computer. In 1983,\\xa0the Soviet satellite alert system\\xa0\\nshowed five ICBMs launched from the US. But it was\\xa0a false alarm caused by\\nsunlight reflected\\xa0on clouds. During the Cuban Missile Crisis, a Soviet submarine with no contact to\\nMoscow for several days concluded that\\xa0\\xa0 nuclear war had begun and decided\\xa0\\nto launch a nuclear torpedo. Luckily the authorization\\xa0\\nof\\xa0\\xa0three officers was required. One of them, Vasily\\xa0Arkhipov, opposed it.\\nBut what if he hadn’t?\\xa0 Any safeguard can fail, no matter\\xa0\\nhow carefully designed it might be. And decisions are being\\xa0made right now\\nto build new weapons and missile\\xa0systems that commit the world to another\\xa0\\ncentury\\xa0of nuclear stalemate, complicated further by\\xa0China's emergence\\nas a new nuclear superpower. Simply accepting that the existence of nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 weapons is inevitable might\\xa0\\nmean their use is\\xa0inevitable. But the world doesn’t have to be\\xa0\\nthis way. Even incremental steps,\\xa0\\xa0 taking apart one bomb at a time, will\\xa0\\neventually result in a world with none.\\xa0\\xa0 During the Cold War, the world had over\\n70,000 nuclear weapons – through arms reduction treaties,\\nthat number is now about 12,500. Progress\\xa0is not guaranteed,\\xa0\\nbut it’s also not impossible. Governments and militaries are not separate\\xa0\\nfrom their nations, they’re part of them,\\xa0\\xa0 just like you.

See you over there!\", \"Black holes can destroy everything – but\\ncan they be destroyed? What happens if we push physics to the absolute\\nlimits, maybe even break it and the universe in the process? Let’s create a tiny black hole, about the\\nmass of our moon, in the Kurzgesagt Labs and try to rip it apart. Nuke It Big booms break things. So to set the mood, let’s explode the world's\\nentire nuclear arsenal around our black hole! Boom Black holes swallow whatever crosses their\\nevent horizon, matter and energy. And since E = mc2, all the energy that enters\\na black hole increases its mass. The mass of a black hole is proportional to\\nits size, so as we nuke our tiny black hole, it just gets bigger and more massive! Antimatter Matter and antimatter annihilate each other. What will happen if we throw a moon's mass\\nof antimatter at it? Unfortunately, when an object enters a black\\nhole, the black hole will completely delete its past identity – whether it’s made\\nof matter or of antimatter. Black holes only care about gravity, which\\nonly depends on the total mass-energy of an object. And the mass of a particle is the same as\\nits corresponding antiparticle, so throwing an anti-moon has the same effect as throwing\\na moon. The black hole just gets more massive! This “deleting ability” of black holes\\nis pretty interesting: It means that, despite their size and power, black holes are, in\\na way, similar to elementary particles. An elementary particle, like an electron,\\nis an extremely simple object, fully specified by just three numbers: its mass, spin and\\ncharge. And amazingly, the same is true for black\\nholes. They have a mass, they can rotate and carry\\nan electric charge. Once a black hole forms, it doesn't matter\\nif it came from a collapsed star, an anti-star or a banana: it will always be fully described\\nby those three numbers, nothing else. But if a black hole is basically a weird particle\\n– could we destroy it with an anti black hole? Anti Black Hole How exciting! A particle has the same mass as its corresponding\\nantiparticle but opposite charge. Since a black hole has mass and electric charge,\\nits corresponding anti black hole should have the same mass and opposite electric charge. What if we make them collide? Sadly, the charge will just add up and cancel\\nout. So after the collision, we’ll just get a\\nnew black hole twice as massive with no charge. OK. We need to think bigger and stretch physics\\nharder. Destroy the Event Horizon It is true that a black hole can carry spin\\nand charge. But even for these crazy objects, there are\\nlimits. If the spin or the charge of a black hole\\nbecomes too large, something really weird will happen: the event horizon will dissolve. In a simplified way, we think of black holes\\nas hiding a singularity inside – an infinitely compressed mass with such strong gravity that\\nabsolutely nothing can escape from its surroundings, not even light. This is why a black hole looks like a “black\\nsphere of nothingness”. The event horizon is the outer edge of this\\nultimate prison. Cross it, and you’ll never be able to come\\nback. But when a black hole rotates, it works a\\nbit like a spinning washing machine. It is as if the rotation wants to repel nearby\\nobjects and push them out of the black hole – which doesn’t happen because its gravity\\nis so strong. BUT – If the rotation gets too fast, this\\neffect will win and the event horizon will disappear – nearby objects won’t be imprisoned\\nforever anymore! The same thing happens with the electric charge. Make it too large, and our ironclad jail will\\nbreak open. If we managed to destroy the event horizon,\\nthe singularity would still be there. And objects would still naturally fall towards\\nit. If you hit it, you would still die horribly\\nand quickly. But the vicinity of the singularity won’t\\nbe an inescapable prison anymore! You could get as close as you want and come\\nback. This should count as destroying the black\\nhole! Can we do it? Overfeeding All we have to do is to overcharge or over-spin\\nthe black hole. We could do this by throwing objects with\\na small mass and a lot of charge or angular momentum, so that the charge or spin increases\\nfaster than the mass. We have to overfeed the black hole until it\\nreaches the point where it breaks open. However, whether you can actually do this\\nis the subject of passionate argument among physicists. Think of a charged black hole. Equal charges repel each other, and the more\\nof the same charges you squish together, the more they push back. So let’s say that we have a negatively charged\\nblack hole and we want to overfeed it with electrons, for example, whose charge is far\\nlarger than its mass. The electrons will feel an electrostatic repulsion. And the more electrons we throw, the larger\\nthe negative charge of the black hole will be and the stronger the repulsion. But once we reach the upper limit, the electrostatic\\nrepulsion will be so strong that it won't allow any more electrons to come in. At this point, the black hole will refuse\\nto be overfed. With the spin it works similarly. Once the black hole reaches its upper limit,\\nit won’t gobble more spin. But some scientists have discovered what looks\\nlike a loophole. If an instant before the black hole reaches\\nthe limit, we throw the right amount matter in just the right way, it looks like we could\\nactually overfeed it. Most scientists are skeptical, but let's give\\nit a try anyway! Breaking Physics There is a catch though. The event horizon of a black hole hides the\\nsingularity. So destroying the horizon would leave us with\\na “naked singularity”, one that is not hidden by an event horizon. And this poses a problem: it could mean the\\nend of physics as we know it. There is a big dirty secret about black holes. Contrary to widespread belief, the singularity\\nof a black hole is not really “at its center”. No. It is in the future of whatever crosses the\\nhorizon. Black holes warp the universe so drastically\\nthat, at the event horizon, space and time switch their roles. Once you cross it, falling towards the center\\nmeans going towards the future. That’s why you cannot escape: Stopping your\\nfall and turning back would be just as impossible as stopping time and traveling to the past. So the singularity is actually in your future,\\nnot “in front of you”. And just like you can’t see your own future,\\nyou won’t see the singularity until you hit it. But you also can’t hit something that is\\nin your future, only sort of… experience it, like you will experience your next birthday\\nwhen it happens. So you will feel the singularity once it happens\\nto you. Singularities that are in the future are not\\na problem because we can’t see them or interact with them. But a naked singularity would be in front\\nof us, for all of us to see. What would we see? Well, the whole point is that it’s impossible\\nto know. A singularity is a region of infinite gravity,\\nand gravity is the bending of spacetime. At a singularity, the bending is so radical\\nthat the fabric of spacetime is literally broken. Space and time don’t exist anymore. This means that you cannot predict anything,\\nsince predicting means making a forecast about where and when something will happen. But “where” and “when” have lost their\\nmeaning! So we have an unpredictable thing with infinite\\ngravity, and therefore infinite energy. This means that anything could come out of\\nit for no reason – from a pile of bananas, to lost socks or a solar system. Predictability, causality and physics as we\\nknow it would break down. We think that singularities should exist in\\nnature because we can prove that, under very general conditions, gravitational collapse\\nleads to the formation of singularities. However, scientists think that nature forbids\\nthe formation of naked singularities. Something enforces the creation of an event\\nhorizon around them, to prevent their insanity from infecting the rest of the universe. Without event horizons, physics may not make\\nsense at all. So although black holes have been portrayed\\nas the ultimate monsters of the universe, they may actually be the heroes that keep\\nus safe from the madness of singularities. So if we do destroy the horizon, we might\\ndestroy the fundamental rules of the universe. You know what? Let’s not do that. The Safe Option As far as we know, there’s just one safe\\nmethod to destroy a black hole: Wait. All black holes emit tiny particles – a\\nphenomenon called Hawking radiation. This process causes them to slowly lose mass\\nuntil they eventually “evaporate”, leaving behind no horizon and no naked singularity. The time it takes for a black hole to completely\\nevaporate depends on its mass. For our mini black hole the size of a speck\\nof dust, it will be about 10^44 years: 10 billion trillion trillion times the present age of\\nthe universe. So, is it possible to destroy a black hole? Yes! We just have to wait. But you don’t have to wait that long.

The carnage\\xa0\\nit caused was so terrible and merciless that\\xa0\\xa0 it compelled humankind, for the first time,\\xa0\\nto act truly globally. It was one of the\\xa0\\xa0 greatest wins of our species over the ancient\\xa0\\npowers of nature, all made possible by… cows.\\xa0 Variola is a virus, a tiny machine that only\\xa0\\nseeks to reproduce itself. Evidence of It has\\xa0\\xa0 been found in Egyptian mummies and in writing\\xa0\\nfrom India and China as old as 3000 years.\\xa0\\xa0 1300 years ago smallpox killed up to a third of\\xa0\\nJapan’s population. By the sixteen hundreds, it\\xa0\\xa0 was one of the major causes of death worldwide.\\xa0\\nIn late 18th century Europe, it killed 400,000\\xa0\\xa0 a year. Every third person who went blind did so\\xa0\\nbecause of this virus. Even in the 20th century,\\xa0\\xa0 a hot second ago in history, it still killed at\\xa0\\nleast 300 million people. Smallpox is an abusive\\xa0\\xa0 monster that returns over and over and over\\xa0\\nagain, killing, maiming, and disrupting societies. How could variola be so incredibly deadly for\\xa0\\nso long and how could we have forgotten its\\xa0\\xa0 horror so quickly? In 2023, there are only\\xa0\\ntwo laboratories left where the living virus\\xa0\\xa0 is officially stored for research:\\xa0\\nin Koltsovo, Russia and in Atlanta,\\xa0\\xa0 USA. Which is certainly a good idea\\xa0\\nbecause what could possibly go wrong? Let’s say that through an unfortunate series of\\xa0\\xa0 events the virus got out and you got\\xa0\\ninfected. What would happen to you? How Smallpox Kills Variola is highly infectious and catches a ride\\xa0\\nin small droplets you breathe in. Immediately it\\xa0\\xa0 begins to infect the cells that line your throat\\xa0\\nand starts killing them to cause chaos. Why?\\xa0\\xa0 To trick your body into giving it\\xa0\\na lift. Whenever cells in your body\\xa0\\xa0 die a violent death, your immune\\xa0\\ncells immediately stream to the\\xa0\\xa0 site of infection to help out. In\\xa0\\nthis case that backfires horribly. As immune cells begin cleaning up dead\\xa0\\ncells, eating viruses and killing infected\\xa0\\xa0 cells , variola infects a crucial cell of\\xa0\\nyour immune system: Your Dendritic cells,\\xa0\\xa0 intelligence cells that gather information\\xa0\\nand leave the battlefield to get help.\\xa0\\xa0 They enter your lymphatic system, a highway\\xa0\\nnetwork that spans your entire body and\\xa0\\xa0 connects hundreds of immune bases. In these\\xa0\\nbases your heavy defenses are activated and\\xa0\\xa0 should be the last place an enemy would want\\xa0\\nto invade, but Variola wants to get here. For about 12 days, the virus quietly\\xa0\\ninfects civilian and immune cells,\\xa0\\xa0 jumping from cell to cell infecting more and more\\xa0\\nof them. At some point a critical threshold is\\xa0\\xa0 reached and variola starts its attack for real.\\xa0\\nMillions of viruses use the lymphatic highway\\xa0\\xa0 to spill into your blood and organs, infecting\\xa0\\nyour whole body. Suddenly variola is everywhere. But despite this global attack, your\\xa0\\nadaptive immune system is struggling to\\xa0\\xa0 wake up. Your immune cells look for and use\\xa0\\ncritical transmitters called interferons to\\xa0\\xa0 mobilize the body against viruses. Interferons,\\xa0\\nas the name suggests, interfere – significantly\\xa0\\xa0 slowing down virus infections but also quickly\\xa0\\nactivating millions of anti virus weapons.\\xa0\\xa0 But Variola is able to deactivate interferons,\\xa0\\nwhich stuns the anti virus side of your defense\\xa0\\xa0 system. Other systems would usually help\\xa0\\n- like the complement system, a sort of\\xa0\\xa0 mobile minefield that can destroy viruses but\\xa0\\nvariola also manages to shut this down too. And so, with little resistance variola spreads\\xa0\\neverywhere and infects billions of your cells\\xa0\\xa0 all over your body. Among the infected are your\\xa0\\ncapillaries, the smallest blood vessels in your\\xa0\\xa0 body, which die in great numbers. All this death\\xa0\\nactivates an immune cell that you really don’t\\xa0\\xa0 need right now but that is attracted by death:\\xa0\\nThe Neutrophil. Normally an efficient killer of\\xa0\\xa0 invaders great and small, it is not very effective\\xa0\\nagainst smallpox. And even worse, Neutrophils\\xa0\\xa0 fight by vomiting deadly chemicals, which\\xa0\\nkills even more of your cells. On top of that,\\xa0\\xa0 they order inflammation, fluids streaming from\\xa0\\nyour blood vessels into your tissue. All over your\\xa0\\xa0 body, as first millions, then billions of your\\xa0\\ncells die, you get a rash that only gets worse\\xa0\\xa0 and worse. Pus and cellular junk fills it up as\\xa0\\nyour body swells up with hundreds of lesions, all\\xa0\\xa0 over your skin and inside, even on your organs,\\xa0\\nall filled with billions of variola viruses. Now the critical phase begins. As you fight\\xa0\\nfor survival, you burn up in a high fever,\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of battlegrounds drain your blood of\\xa0\\nfluid that streams into your tissue and organs.\\xa0\\xa0 Blood clotting appears all over your body while\\xa0\\nfloods of toxins from dead cells build up and can\\xa0\\xa0 cause organs to fail. Your lungs fill up with\\xa0\\nfluid, making it harder and harder to breathe.\\xa0\\xa0 One of two things happens now: Either your immune\\xa0\\nsystem wrestles back control – heavy weapons have\\xa0\\xa0 been dispatched, killing infected cells, cleaning\\xa0\\nup the thousands of infections one by one,\\xa0\\xa0 killing variola wherever it can be found so\\xa0\\nyou can slowly begin to recover. The immune\\xa0\\xa0 system will forever remember variola, making\\xa0\\nyou immune forever. Or, you die, overwhelmed\\xa0\\xa0 by the infection and your immune system\\'s\\xa0\\npanicked reaction to the body wide infection. About a third of people who contract\\xa0\\nsmallpox don’t survive. And if you survive,\\xa0\\xa0 you are very likely branded by scars and\\xa0\\nmay even lose your eyesight or hearing. For thousands of years this terrible disease\\xa0\\nravaged the world, leaving death and destruction,\\xa0\\xa0 traumatized and maimed survivors. Until\\xa0\\none day, humanity said: “enough”. \\n \\xa0 Why don’t we have smallpox anymore? Smallpox is one of the worst diseases\\xa0\\nhumanity has ever known. A murderous,\\xa0\\xa0 family destroying, life ruining monster.\\xa0\\nThere was nothing you could do for the\\xa0\\xa0 infected – but people noticed that\\xa0\\nif you survived, you were immune.\\xa0\\xa0 So out of desperation, they came up with a\\xa0\\ndangerous practice of variolation: Take scabs\\xa0\\xa0 from an infected person that had a mild case of\\xa0\\nsmallpox, let them dry out and grind them to a\\xa0\\xa0 fine powder. Then blow the powder up the nostril\\xa0\\nof a patient or scratch their skin with it. If\\xa0\\xa0 things went well, they only got a mild version of\\xa0\\nsmallpox and gained immunity against the disease. Variolation probably worked because it introduced\\xa0\\nthe variola in a part of the body the virus wasn’t\\xa0\\xa0 prepared for, disabling most of its nasty\\xa0\\ntricks. And because the inoculation was\\xa0\\xa0 left to dry out, that damaged the virus\\xa0\\nso it could not cause the full disease. Unfortunately 2-3% of all patients still died\\xa0\\nbecause they got the smallpox or suffered\\xa0\\xa0 other diseases as a result of treatment. Still,\\xa0\\nsmallpox was such a horrible and to some degree,\\xa0\\xa0 unavoidable disease that people took the\\xa0\\nrisk, for themselves and their children.\\xa0\\xa0 Variolation spread around the globe,\\xa0\\nwhile Variola continued to kill millions. A victory over the virus only became a real\\xa0\\npossibility when scientists realized that\\xa0\\xa0 it was not necessary to variolate with the\\xa0\\nreal smallpox disease, but much safer to use\\xa0\\xa0 material from cowpox, a variant that affected,\\xa0\\nsurprise, cows. A truly revolutionary step – and\\xa0\\xa0 only a few years later, this led to one of\\xa0\\nhumankind\\'s most outstanding achievements:\\xa0\\xa0 Vaccinations. The innovation was simple –\\xa0\\ninstead of using the real virus to train\\xa0\\xa0 the immune system, use a related virus, cowpox,\\xa0\\nthat was only mild but also gave you immunity. Still, it would take another 200 years, countless\\xa0\\nindividuals fighting the monster where they could,\\xa0\\xa0 delivering vaccines to the most remote places\\xa0\\non earth. All the while the disease ravaged on,\\xa0\\xa0 killing over 300 million people\\xa0\\nin the 20th century alone. In 1966 the World Health Organization decided\\xa0\\nthat humanity had to come together in a final,\\xa0\\xa0 major effort. A global \"smallpox news\\xa0\\nnetwork,\" based on residents in hotspots, was\\xa0\\xa0 created – tackling local outbreaks of the virus.\\xa0\\nCases were encircled, vaccines given, preventing\\xa0\\xa0 further spread. Smallpox only infects humans,\\xa0\\nso if we stopped the human transmission chain,\\xa0\\xa0 we would starve the virus. The last naturally\\xa0\\noccurring infection was in 1977, and in 1980,\\xa0\\xa0 just shy of 200 years since the first vaccine\\xa0\\nwas used, Smallpox was declared eradicated.

On the one hand solving the deadliest diseases\\nwhile also creating viruses more dangerous than nuclear bombs, able to devastate humanity. What is going on? Biotechnology is increasingly everywhere. The cotton in your clothes, the vegetables\\nyou eat, your dog. Humans manipulate living things. We use bacteria to produce insulin, connect\\nprosthetics directly with our brains and make industrial enzymes to produce paper. Gene therapy creates cures to previously untreatable\\ndiseases while we are working on food crops resistant to climate change.\\xa0 Our mastery over biology has been speeding\\nup so much that within weeks of the first Covid 19 case, the unknown coronavirus was\\nbroken down in laboratories and analysed. Scientists generated a copy of its genetic\\nmaterial to create a vaccine that was ready for testing months after the pandemic began. Something unthinkable a decade ago. Where is all this sudden progress coming from? Well, it's complicated. But in a nutshell: really expensive things\\ngot cheap and knowledge of how to do impressive things spread freely. The Human Genome Project starting in 1990\\nwas the first major attempt to read human DNA in its entirety. 13 years and $3 billion\\nlater, it was complete. By then the cost of decoding a human genome\\nhad fallen to about $100 million. Today it is 100,000 times cheaper, costing\\nonly about $1000. How is that possible? Converting DNA into computer data and then\\nstudying it used to be a super tedious process, taking expert humans around 3 years of manual\\nwork. Today it takes about two weeks and is almost\\ncompletely automated.\\xa0 Biotechnology has gone from something restricted\\nto the best and well-funded laboratories staffed by the world's top experts, to something affordable\\nenough for hundreds of thousands of people to casually work on.\\xa0 What has sped up the process even more is\\nthat information in the field is shared widely and freely. Cutting-edge discoveries now take just about\\na year to be copied in laboratories around the world, a few years for anyone with a biology\\nbackground to work out, and a bit over a decade for high school students to experiment with\\nthem in schools. Imagine that your local computer repair shop\\ncould build a pristine Iphone 11 with just the parts lying around, and that teenagers\\nare asked to build a new Iphone 5 for homework. Not a crappy homemade version, the real thing. This is what is going on right now in biotechnology\\n– a true revolution.\\xa0 We are adding knowledge at unprecedented rates,\\nwhile things get ever faster and cheaper to do. This speed means we can expect even more wonderful\\nthings for humanity. Lifesaving treatments, miracle crops and solutions\\nto problems we can’t even imagine right now.\\xa0 But unfortunately progress cuts both ways. What can be used for good, can also be used\\nfor bad, by accident or on purpose.\\xa0 For all the good biotech will do for us, in\\nthe near future it also could easily kill many millions of people, in the worst case\\nhundreds of millions. Worse than any nuclear bomb. The world just witnessed how fast the novel\\ncoronavirus spread. We still do not know for sure if it came from\\nnature or was the result of an accidental leak from a lab working with corona viruses,\\nthat’s still subject to scientific debate. In the end at least 7 million people died. And this was still a relatively mild virus\\nthat didn’t cause serious disease in most of those infected. But that might change in the future. Wherever the last pandemic came from, the\\nnext one might very well be our own fault –\\xa0in a sense, many things going on in biotechnology\\ncould lead to this. Most of all how easy it is to work with dangerous\\nviruses. Thousands of scientists can simply order the\\ngenetic data of infectious virus samples online to experiment with them. Assembling these into an artificial virus\\nin 2023 costs about as much as a new car, including all the lab equipment.\\xa0 At the same time, other scientists are trying\\nto find viruses that hide in nature, like in wild bats or monkeys. There are probably plenty of potentially deadly\\npandemics out there. Virus hunters take samples back to the lab\\nto learn whether the newly discovered viruses are likely to spread in humans and catalogue\\nthe danger. When a biologist discovers a new virus, they\\nusually publish its genetic data to the public. Journals are eager to share descriptions of\\npotentially dangerous viruses.\\xa0 Other labs go further and make viruses more\\ndangerous. They combine and mutate different viruses\\nto understand which mutations make them more likely to spread between humans or make them\\ndeadlier than their original forms. And again, these results are shared freely. All while synthetic DNA and equipment to rebuild\\nthese viruses are sold online to anyone without any or very little tracking. As the tools of biotechnology get ever cheaper\\nand easy to use and the data on dangerous viruses keeps multiplying, it is only a matter\\nof time before a well-meaning scientist shares blueprints for the equivalent nuclear bomb\\nof viruses, a superbug that will cause millions of deaths  – and someone uses it. Maybe because they have bad intentions, maybe\\nbecause they are irresponsible or sloppy. We are creating an environment in which it\\nis increasingly easy for anyone to create a weaponized virus in their backyard.\\xa0 This is scary. The world would be plunged into an unending\\ncrisis as new pandemics pop up year after year or all at once – killing large parts\\nof the world’s population, doing unimaginable damage to civilisation as a whole, and possibly\\nundoing centuries of progress.\\xa0 It’s not the first time we’ve faced a\\nchallenge like this and we are not helpless – think of nuclear technology. Something extremely powerful and dangerous\\nwith huge upsides and downsides. Nuclear energy was born from weapon programs,\\nso its creators were always aware of the potential for their knowledge to be abused. From the very beginning it was clear that\\nknowledge in this field and access to the technology needed to be handled with utmost\\ncare.\\xa0 So a lot of effort has gone into making sure\\nno radioactive material disappears from sight or that countries don’t try to hide weapons\\ndevelopment behind energy programs. The result hasn’t been perfect, but considering\\nthe 411 nuclear power stations running today, we’ve been very successful. Likewise, no researcher would think to share\\ndata on how to turn common laboratory equipment into bomb-making machines on the internet.\\xa0 There is no reason we could not handle the\\nreally dangerous aspects of biotechnology in a similar way! Experts have come up with three sort of bullet\\npoints: First we need to delay the next deadly pandemic\\nby getting a grip on how we treat dangerous viruses. Their genetic data should be treated as an\\ninfohazard: information that poses a danger to society if it is shared without care. In other words, not just anyone should be\\nable to order dangerous DNA online. And if you do, you should be tracked, so it\\nbecomes much harder for the wrong people to access the really spicy stuff.\\xa0 The next step is detecting the danger by becoming\\naware which viruses are present among us and are spreading explosively between humans. This could be as easy as having labs in population\\ncentres maintain virus detectors that monitor what is going on in the micro world. If we suddenly see certain microorganisms\\nshow up a lot in a short time, we can react quickly and start counter measures. Which is the final step: Destroy. We basically need to build a machine that\\nis ready to destroy any pandemic threat before it has a chance to take over. We can do this with new tools that are being\\ndeveloped right now, like nanofilters that pull dangers out of the air we breathe or\\nspecialized UV lamps that just kill any virus before it has a chance to jump from person\\nto person. And of course, we need to get better at getting\\nnew vaccines faster than ever before in history. If we do these three things, the chances are really\\ngood that we can avoid a catastrophic pandemic in the future.\\xa0 Biotechnology,\\xa0 like any exciting and powerful\\ntechnology, is neither inherently good or bad. It has the potential to be both in breathtaking\\nways. We have the chance to a future where we get\\nto truly control biology  - our biology,  the biology of the plants and animals around us\\n–\\xa0and the biology of the microworld. So let’s use it to create a future where\\nwe triumph over pandemics and diseases for good. This video was supported by Open Philanthropy.

This is what happens when\\xa0\\xa0 your body fights cancer, more exciting than any\\xa0\\nmovie. How does this battle for survival unfold? 1. The Elimination Phase It all begins with a single corrupted cell. It\\xa0\\nis no longer able to repair its genetic code,\\xa0\\xa0 it can’t kill itself anymore and it is beginning\\xa0\\nto multiply rapidly. At this point things are\\xa0\\xa0 not great, not terrible – this cell is not yet\\xa0\\ndangerous but if nothing happens, it soon will be. Over a few weeks the corrupted cell keeps making\\xa0\\ncopies of itself. One cell turns into dozens,\\xa0\\xa0 hundreds, thousands. Because the\\xa0\\noriginal was broken, its copies are\\xa0\\xa0 breaking and mutating even more. They\\xa0\\nturn into different genetic lineages,\\xa0\\xa0 clans that are working together and competing.\\xa0\\nSome mutate in a way that makes them weaker,\\xa0\\xa0 others’ mutations don’t change anything,\\xa0\\nwhile a few become fitter and better at\\xa0\\xa0 survival. Together they now form a tiny, tiny\\xa0\\ntumor. Not cancer yet, but getting there. The growing tumor needs a lot of resources.\\xa0\\nIf the cells don’t get food and oxygen,\\xa0\\xa0 they will die and the problem just solves itself.\\xa0\\nUnfortunately a few corrupted cells unlock a new\\xa0\\xa0 mutation that saves them: The ability to\\xa0\\norder the growth of new blood vessels. And\\xa0\\xa0 so your body provides the supply they need to\\xa0\\nsurvive. But as the tumor continues to grow,\\xa0\\xa0 it starts causing damage – Neighbouring\\xa0\\nhealthy cells begin to starve and die,\\xa0\\xa0 which attracts attention. In a sense\\xa0\\nthis tiny tumor is like a rogue town. Imagine a group of rebels in Brooklyn decided that\\xa0\\nthey were no longer part of New York but started a\\xa0\\xa0 new settlement called Tumor Town, which happens to\\xa0\\noccupy the same space. The new city wants to grow,\\xa0\\xa0 so it orders tons of steel beams, cement\\xa0\\nand drywall. New buildings follow no logic,\\xa0\\xa0 are badly planned, ugly and dangerously crooked.\\xa0\\nThey are built right in the middle of streets,\\xa0\\xa0 on top of playgrounds and on existing\\xa0\\ninfrastructure. The old neighborhood\\xa0\\xa0 is torn down or overbuilt to make\\xa0\\nroom for new stuff. Many of the\\xa0\\xa0 former residents are trapped in the\\xa0\\nmiddle of it and begin to starve. This goes on for a while until the\\xa0\\nsmell of death finally attracts\\xa0\\xa0 attention. Building inspectors and police show up. In your body, attracted by the stench of dead\\xa0\\ncells your immune system is activated. First\\xa0\\xa0 responder immune cells invade the tumor:\\xa0\\nMacrophages and Natural Killer Cells,\\xa0\\xa0 police forces that go right to work, killing\\xa0\\nand eating tumor cells. They release chemical\\xa0\\xa0 signals that let the whole immune system\\xa0\\nknow that there is cancer to be eradicated. Dendritic Cells, the intelligence\\xa0\\nofficers of your immune system,\\xa0\\xa0 collect samples of dead tumor cells and begin\\xa0\\nactivating your heavy weapons: Helper and Killer\\xa0\\xa0 T Cells. We explained these specialized super\\xa0\\nweapons in another video, but all you really\\xa0\\xa0 need to know is that they have a library listing\\xa0\\nevery bad thing that could come into your body. While each cancer is unique, there are\\xa0\\ngenetic corruptions that they can’t hide.\\xa0\\xa0 And your T Cells know what to look for. They\\xa0\\nare the deadliest cancer killers you have. By the time they arrive, the tumor has\\xa0\\ngrown to hundreds of thousands of cells,\\xa0\\xa0 but this is about to change. T Cells\\xa0\\nblock the growth of new blood vessels,\\xa0\\xa0 which starves thousands of tumor\\xa0\\ncells and puts an end to their growth. Imagine the building inspectors, switching\\xa0\\noff electricity and water and putting up\\xa0\\xa0 roadblocks to cancertown so no more\\xa0\\nfood and materials can be delivered. With no way to hide from the carnage unfolding,\\xa0\\nthe tumor collapses as hundreds of thousands of\\xa0\\xa0 tumor cells are massacred. Their carcasses are\\xa0\\ncleaned up and consumed by Macrophages that then\\xa0\\xa0 order healthy tissue to regenerate. Your body\\xa0\\nhas crushed the illegal Tumor Town without mercy. You will never know about this fight or how\\xa0\\nmany times this has happened inside your body. Except… in this case something\\xa0\\ndid not go as planned. 2. The Equilibrium Phase Unfortunately, natural selection spoils your\\xa0\\nvictory. By doing its best to destroy the tumor,\\xa0\\xa0 your immune system accidentally selects\\xa0\\nthe fittest tumor cells. Remember,\\xa0\\xa0 the tumor consists of different lineages\\xa0\\nthat keep growing and keep mutating. Most\\xa0\\xa0 of these are eradicated. But just a few\\xa0\\nare more resilient. One cell survives – it\\xa0\\xa0 comes from the fittest tumor lineage and was\\xa0\\njust a bit better at surviving the massacre\\xa0\\xa0 than anyone else. It decides to do it\\xa0\\nall over again. But better this time. This tumor cell is much stronger than any of\\xa0\\nthe thousands that were killed. Maybe it is\\xa0\\xa0 better at hiding, or fighting back. Maybe\\xa0\\nit grows faster or is better at stealing\\xa0\\xa0 resources. Maybe it can survive with much\\xa0\\nless oxygen. And so it all begins again. It's like the surviving rebels that started\\xa0\\nTumor Town have learned their lessons. Now\\xa0\\xa0 they know the law better and how to break it,\\xa0\\nwhat permits help them, how to avoid the police. And so the surviving tumor cell makes thousands\\xa0\\nof copies that mutate and form new lineages,\\xa0\\xa0 until once again a tumor has grown,\\xa0\\nmade up from more resilient cells.\\xa0\\xa0 The immune system does not care though, and this\\xa0\\ntime it even has experience - instead of starting\\xa0\\xa0 with police, swat teams go right in to tear Tumor\\xa0\\nTown down, killing its inhabitants without mercy. But once again they don’t get everyone. One\\xa0\\nof them survives: a fitter tumor Cell from\\xa0\\xa0 an already fitter lineage. This time it gets\\xa0\\na cheap suit and studies the building code,\\xa0\\xa0 pretending to be a lawyer to start Tumor Town all\\xa0\\nover again. This struggle now repeats a few times,\\xa0\\xa0 each time the rebels learn a bit more about\\xa0\\nhow to avoid the law. If at any point,\\xa0\\xa0 the immune system gets all of the tumor cells,\\xa0\\nthe story ends. But in this case, it doesn’t. Finally, a tumor cell changes in a way\\xa0\\nthat makes it properly dangerous, cancer.\\xa0\\xa0 The type that kills people. How? Immune cells have an off switch that deactivates\\xa0\\nthem before they can attack – which in principle\\xa0\\xa0 is a good idea. The immune system is extremely\\xa0\\ndangerous and in many cases it needs to be\\xa0\\xa0 shut down, like around your central nervous\\xa0\\nsystem. But this off switch can be exploited. The mutated tumor cell finds a way to switch the\\xa0\\nimmune system off by targeting inhibitor receptors\\xa0\\xa0 on anti cancer cells. Inhibitor receptors\\xa0\\nstop immune cells from, well, killing.\\xa0 This cell is the now powerful founder of a\\xa0\\nnew lineage of cancer cells and mass produces\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of new copies that once again change and\\xa0\\nmutate further. Building yet another Tumor Town. 3. The Escape Phase The new cancer cells have become immune to\\xa0\\nthe immune system and everything is different\\xa0\\xa0 this time. Tumor Town has been rebuilt,\\xa0\\neven uglier and stranger than before,\\xa0\\xa0 but now the cancer city council\\xa0\\nhas forged all sorts of permits.\\xa0\\xa0 As building inspectors come to shut\\xa0\\ndown construction, they get confused.\\xa0\\xa0 Stunned they wander off, unable to order\\xa0\\nthe destruction of the sprawling buildings. Police try to enter the illegal city\\xa0\\nto arrest the builders and execute\\xa0\\xa0 inhabitants – but this time Tumor Town\\xa0\\nhas erected its own roadblocks that keep\\xa0\\xa0 the law from entering. Confused\\xa0\\nofficers stand around helplessly. As Tumor Town slowly envelops the former\\xa0\\nBrooklyn and more and more civilians die,\\xa0\\xa0 T Cell swat teams arrive to end this travesty.\\xa0\\nBut things got worse – new lineages of Tumor Town\\xa0\\xa0 officials have started to forge court documents\\xa0\\nthat order police to shoot at the Swat teams. What the cancer cells are doing at this\\xa0\\npoint is actively shutting down immune\\xa0\\xa0 defenses by sending corrupt signals. The now\\xa0\\nmalignant tumor is no longer a pushover and\\xa0\\xa0 has begun creating the Cancer Microenvironment.\\xa0\\nA sort of borderland that is hard to cross. All\\xa0\\xa0 avenues of attack have been shut down and\\xa0\\nuncontrollable growth is the consequence.\\n \\xa0 This is a dangerous tumor. Cells\\xa0\\nthat are strong and able to fight,\\xa0\\xa0 push your immune system back and expand further.\\xa0\\nIf more mutations happen, then some of the cancer\\xa0\\xa0 cells will begin to explore the world and\\xa0\\nexpand into other tissues, to build new towns. And this is exactly what makes cancer\\xa0\\nso harmful: it is taking up space and\\xa0\\xa0 stealing so many nutrients that your true\\xa0\\nself has no room to function anymore.\\xa0\\xa0 If this goes on for too\\xa0\\nlong, organs will shut down. But this tactic is a dead end. The more\\xa0\\nsuccessful cancer gets, the more damage it\\xa0\\xa0 does to its world. When the body dies, the cancer\\xa0\\ndies too. It truly is a game without winners. Except, humanity is planning to win this game. At this moment hundreds of thousands of scientists\\xa0\\nare working on new and better ways of killing\\xa0\\xa0 cancer, to destroy and burn down Tumor Towns\\xa0\\nfor good. In recent years immunotherapy has\\xa0\\xa0 made enormous progress – it is a relatively\\xa0\\nnew therapy in which your own immune cells are\\xa0\\xa0 modified to kill cancer better than any medicine\\xa0\\ncan do. It's like giving your building inspectors\\xa0\\xa0 machine guns and flamethrowers. But this is a\\xa0\\nstory another time – For\\xa0\\xa0 now cancer is a battleground – but if human\\xa0\\ningenuity is to be trusted, then one day,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe in the not too distant future, we\\xa0\\nwill eradicate it once and for all.

Just a small\\xa0\\nfraction of all atoms are found in galaxies,\\xa0\\xa0 while the rest is thought to be drifting\\xa0\\nin between, in the intergalactic medium.\\xa0\\xa0 Like the roots of some massive tree,\\xa0\\ngas spreads out from each galaxy,\\xa0\\xa0 gravity funneling fresh mass\\xa0\\ninto this dense, cosmic forest. \\n \\xa0 Here in the intergalactic medium, are the raw\\xa0\\nmaterials of creation: hydrogen and helium,\\xa0\\xa0 woven into sheets and filaments that flow into\\xa0\\ngalaxies where they eventually create stars. But if we look closely, we see who is actually in\\xa0\\ncharge: Quasars, the single most powerful objects\\xa0\\xa0 in existence. As small as a grain of sand compared\\xa0\\nto the amazon river, they reside in the centers\\xa0\\xa0 of some galaxies, shining with the power of a\\xa0\\ntrillion stars, blasting out huge jets of matter,\\xa0\\xa0 completely reshaping the cosmos around them.\\xa0\\nThey are so powerful that they can kill a galaxy. What are they, and how do they mold the\\xa0\\nstructure of the universe at their whim? Everywhere You Look, Weird Things in the Sky In the 1950s astronomers noticed mysterious\\xa0\\nloud radio-waves coming from spots all over\\xa0\\xa0 the sky. They were named “quasi-stellar\\xa0\\nradio sources”, or “quasars” because they\\xa0\\xa0 were dots like stars, but were seen in\\xa0\\nradio waves rather than visible light. Everything about them was strange. Some flickered,\\xa0\\nothers emitted high energy X-rays in addition to\\xa0\\xa0 radio waves, but all seemed to be tiny. They\\xa0\\nalso moved extremely fast, as much as over 30%\\xa0\\xa0 the speed of light. The only explanation was\\xa0\\nthat they must have been so distant that their\\xa0\\xa0 apparent speed was actually the expansion\\xa0\\nof the universe moving them away from us. But these enormous distances meant that quasars\\xa0\\ncouldn’t just be stars, but the active cores of\\xa0\\xa0 galaxies billions of lightyears away! And it\\xa0\\ngets crazier. To appear so bright and loud,\\xa0\\xa0 given these vast distances, they are thousands\\xa0\\nof times brighter than the entire Milky Way.\\xa0\\xa0 Monsters, exploding and screaming into the void\\xa0\\nwith a violence not thought possible before. As we mapped the sky, we discovered over a million\\xa0\\nquasars. And they all seemed to be very far away.\\xa0\\xa0 Looking into space, far away means very\\xa0\\nlong ago, because their light takes so\\xa0\\xa0 long to reach us. Quasars were common\\xa0\\nin the early universe, having peaked\\xa0\\xa0 in number 10 billion years ago when galaxies,\\xa0\\nand the universe itself was still very young. Let’s go back in time, just 3 billion years after\\xa0\\nthe big bang and see what was going on back then. The Incredible Power of Quasars How could an early baby galaxy be\\xa0\\nso incredibly bright and violent? All that light and radiation couldn’t be\\xa0\\nstars, as there weren’t nearly enough of\\xa0\\xa0 them. And since galaxies tend\\xa0\\nto grow with time by merging,\\xa0\\xa0 the starlight from small galaxies shouldn’t\\xa0\\nbe far brighter than any galaxy today. There’s only one way to generate the vast\\xa0\\namounts of energy a quasar shines with:\\xa0\\xa0 feeding supermassive black holes. We\\xa0\\nstill don’t know how exactly they formed,\\xa0\\xa0 but it seems that every galaxy\\xa0\\nhas one in their center. But how can the brightest things\\xa0\\nin the universe be black holes,\\xa0\\xa0 which trap anything and everything\\xa0\\nthat crosses their event horizon?\\xa0\\xa0 Well the light of a quasar is not coming\\xa0\\nfrom inside these black holes. Rather,\\xa0\\xa0 it comes from the space around them, a massive\\xa0\\norbiting disk of gas called an ‘accretion disk.’ Quasars use the same fuel as stars to shine:\\xa0\\nMatter. It is just that black holes are the\\xa0\\xa0 most efficient engines for converting\\xa0\\nmatter into energy in the universe.\\xa0\\xa0 The energy released by matter falling\\xa0\\ninto a black hole can be 60 times\\xa0\\xa0 greater than that released by nuclear\\xa0\\nfusion in the core of a star. Because\\xa0\\xa0 the energy released by a black hole comes\\xa0\\nfrom gravity, not from nuclear reactions. Matter falling into a black hole speeds up to\\xa0\\nalmost the speed of light before it crosses\\xa0\\xa0 the event horizon, buzzing with an incredible\\xa0\\namount of kinetic energy. Of course, once inside\\xa0\\xa0 the black hole, it takes that energy with it. You\\xa0\\nonly get to witness this energy if you drop your\\xa0\\xa0 matter in the right way. Fall straight down and\\xa0\\nthe outside universe gets nothing. But when you\\xa0\\xa0 have a lot of matter, it spirals in incredibly\\xa0\\nfast towards the event horizon forming a disk.\\xa0\\xa0 Collisions between particles and friction heat\\xa0\\nit up to hundreds of thousands of degrees.\\xa0\\xa0 In a space not much bigger than our solar system,\\xa0\\xa0 the core of a galaxy can release many times\\xa0\\nmore energy than all its stars combined. This is what a quasar is, a super\\xa0\\nmassive black hole having a feast. And these black holes eat a lot. Typical\\xa0\\nquasars consume one to a hundred Earth masses\\xa0\\xa0 of gas per minute! Ten billion years ago, the\\xa0\\nuniverse was about a third of its current size,\\xa0\\xa0 so the intergalactic medium was much less\\xa0\\nspread out, meaning the filaments of gas\\xa0\\xa0 around quasars could feed them a banquet, making\\xa0\\nthem vomit insane amounts of light and radiation. The brightest quasars power jets, tangling the\\xa0\\nmagnetic field of the matter around them into\\xa0\\xa0 a narrow cone. Like a particle accelerator\\xa0\\nthey launch enormous beams of matter out,\\xa0\\xa0 plowing through the circumgalactic medium,\\xa0\\nforming plumes of matter that grow to hundreds\\xa0\\xa0 of thousands of lightyears in size. It’s\\xa0\\nalmost unfathomable in scale. A tiny spot\\xa0\\xa0 in a galaxy carving out patches of the\\xa0\\nuniverse 100,000s of light years long. But quasars can’t eat for long,\\xa0\\nmaybe a few million years,\\xa0\\xa0 because their feast ultimately kills their galaxy. How Quasars Kill Galaxies Okay, maybe “killing” is a bit of an exaggeration.\\xa0\\nA galaxy is still there after its quasar turns\\xa0\\xa0 off. But it will never be the same again. Quasars,\\xa0\\nbeing among the hottest and brightest things in\\xa0\\xa0 the universe, break their galaxies by heating\\xa0\\nthem up too much and stopping star formation. Hot gas cannot form stars. This sounds odd,\\xa0\\nbecause Stars are gas that collapsed in\\xa0\\xa0 on itself and then got really hot. But\\xa0\\nin a cloud of gas that is already hot,\\xa0\\xa0 atoms are moving quickly. When they collide,\\xa0\\nthey hit hard, exerting pressure that resists\\xa0\\xa0 gravity’s squeeze – so hot gas can’t\\xa0\\nform stars. Instead, the best gas for\\xa0\\xa0 forming stars is already cold, and won’t put up\\xa0\\na fight when it’s time to collapse into a star. On top of that, quasars push gas out of\\xa0\\ntheir galaxies. Not only does this starve\\xa0\\xa0 the quasar, but its galaxy loses\\xa0\\nthe raw materials for new stars. As sad as this sounds, it might be a\\xa0\\ngood thing for life. The alternative\\xa0\\xa0 can be far more dangerous: too many stars.\\xa0\\nNew stars forming is usually followed by\\xa0\\xa0 massive stars exploding in supernovae,\\xa0\\nso planets would be burned sterile. But of course it's more complicated. Like the\\xa0\\nintricacies of our own planet’s biosphere,\\xa0\\xa0 every piece of the galaxy is dependent on and\\xa0\\ninfluencing every other part of the galactic\\xa0\\xa0 environment. While hot things, like quasars and\\xa0\\nsupernovae, tend to push gas out of the galaxy,\\xa0\\xa0 shockwaves and quasar jets can also compress\\xa0\\ngas, making new stars at least for a short\\xa0\\xa0 time. And gas that leaves will mix with gas coming\\xa0\\nback in and recycle it back into the galaxy. But\\xa0\\xa0 in general we can say that without\\xa0\\nthings becoming a bit more chill,\\xa0\\xa0 we would not exist today. Which\\xa0\\nbrings us to our final question: Did the Milky Way Have a Quasar in the Past? It’s unclear if every galaxy went through a\\xa0\\nquasar phase, but understanding distant quasars\\xa0\\xa0 may provide clues to the history of the Milky\\xa0\\nWay. Galaxies don’t do a good job of preserving\\xa0\\xa0 their history. Like sand on a beach the endless\\xa0\\nchurning mixes away the clues to their past. It’s possible the Milky Way was once a quasar,\\xa0\\xa0 which may have allowed our supermassive\\xa0\\nblack hole Sagittarius A star to have\\xa0\\xa0 grown to 4 million times the mass of the sun.\\xa0\\nBut sadly we don’t know its ancient history. And as dormant as it is now, Sagittarius A star\\xa0\\ncould turn into a quasar in the future. In a few\\xa0\\xa0 billion years the Milky Way will merge with\\xa0\\nAndromeda. We’ve seen over a hundred ‘double\\xa0\\xa0 quasars’ in galaxies smashing together, where\\xa0\\nfresh gas is provided for the central black holes.\\xa0\\xa0 But it won’t last for long. When galaxies\\xa0\\nmerge, so do their super massive black holes,\\xa0\\xa0 sinking into the center of their new galaxy,\\xa0\\nkicking up dust and stars in every direction. We don’t know whether this will happen, but\\xa0\\nit would truly be an incredible sight. Maybe\\xa0\\xa0 some beings in the far future are going to\\xa0\\nwitness it and be in awe of what they see.

It does that all the time.\\xa0\\xa0 The vast majority of cancer cells you\\xa0\\ndevelop will be killed without you ever\\xa0\\xa0 noticing. Which is an incredibly hard\\xa0\\njob because of what cancer cells are:\\xa0\\xa0 parts of yourself that start to behave\\xa0\\nas individuals even if it hurts you. \\n \\xa0 What is cancer and how does\\xa0\\nyour body kill it all the time? INTRO Cancer is when corrupted\\xa0\\ncells multiply uncontrollably. It can emerge from basically\\xa0\\nevery type of cell in your body,\\xa0\\xa0 so there is not just a single\\xa0\\ntype of cancer but hundreds.\\xa0\\xa0 Some grow slowly, others are aggressive, some\\xa0\\ncan be treated effectively, others are deadly. In a sense, a cell that becomes cancer turns\\xa0\\ninto something ancient and something new. Over\\xa0\\xa0 billions of years, evolution has molded cells\\xa0\\nto survive and thrive in a hostile environment,\\xa0\\xa0 fighting for space and resources. Until a new\\xa0\\nand exciting way of life emerged: Cooperation,\\xa0\\xa0 a division of labour that allowed cells to\\xa0\\nspecialize and become more successful together.\\xa0\\xa0 But cooperation requires sacrifices. For\\xa0\\na multicellular being to stay healthy,\\xa0\\xa0 the wellbeing of the collective has to matter\\xa0\\nmore than the survival of the individual cell. Cancer cells stop being part of the\\xa0\\ncollective and become individuals again.\\xa0\\xa0 Your body can handle a few rogue cells but\\xa0\\nsome cancer cells divide, again, and again,\\xa0\\xa0 becoming a sort of new organism within\\xa0\\nyou. Taking resources you need to survive,\\xa0\\xa0 competing for the space you inhabit, destroying\\xa0\\nthe organs they were part of in the process. Despite the harm they cause, cancer cells\\xa0\\nare not evil. They don’t want to hurt you.\\xa0\\xa0 They don’t want anything. Cells are protein\\xa0\\nrobots that just follow their programming,\\xa0\\xa0 which unfortunately has been corrupted. The Soul of the Cell In a nutshell, your cells have a nucleus filled\\xa0\\nwith DNA. It consists of genes – instructions\\xa0\\xa0 for how to build proteins and when to make\\xa0\\neach one.These building instructions are\\xa0\\xa0 copied and transferred to ribosomes, where\\xa0\\nthey are used to make proteins. What kind\\xa0\\xa0 of proteins your cells make determine what\\xa0\\nthey can do. The important thing here is\\xa0\\xa0 that a corrupt gene means you get a corrupt\\xa0\\nprotein, which will get important later. Your DNA gets a tiny bit corrupted – it\\xa0\\nmutates – tens of thousands of times each day.\\xa0\\xa0 Most of the time without any\\xa0\\nspecial cause, just by being alive.\\xa0\\xa0 Almost all of these mutations are fixed\\xa0\\nvery quickly or are not problematic. Still, over time as your cells\\xa0\\nmake copies of themselves,\\xa0\\xa0 damage is accumulating. Imagine having\\xa0\\nto make copies from copies from copies,\\xa0\\xa0 for decades. Maybe one day a hair got\\xa0\\non the scanner or a corner got frayed.\\xa0\\xa0 Each new mistake becomes part of the new\\xa0\\ncopies and all the copies that follow. You can increase DNA damage by doing\\xa0\\nthings like smoking, drinking alcohol,\\xa0\\xa0 by being obese, breathing in asbestos, by\\xa0\\nnot using sunscreen or contracting a virus\\xa0\\xa0 like HPV. But the simplest way to damage DNA\\xa0\\nand get cancer is to be alive long enough.\\xa0\\xa0 For many cancer cases, there is\\xa0\\nno cause other than bad luck. The Damage that leads to Cancer We are simplifying, but roughly,\\xa0\\xa0 there are three categories of genes that\\xa0\\nneed to be corrupted so cancer can arise. The first key mutation is in the appropriately\\xa0\\nnamed tumor suppressor genes, or TSGs.\\xa0\\xa0 These genes are a bunch of things. For\\xa0\\none, they produce control mechanisms that\\xa0\\xa0 continuously scan your DNA for mistakes\\xa0\\nand copying errors and fix them right\\xa0\\xa0 away. And then they keep normal cells from\\xa0\\nmultiplying recklessly. If TSGs become damaged,\\xa0\\xa0 your cells basically forget how to repair\\xa0\\nthemselves and can reproduce unchecked. The second crucial mutation can happen in your\\xa0\\noncogenes. When oncogenes are turned on the\\xa0\\xa0 cell is told to multiply rapidly.They were super\\xa0\\nactive when you were inside your mother’s womb.\\xa0\\xa0 To turn a single original cell into\\xa0\\ntrillions in months, it needs to divide\\xa0\\xa0 and grow rapidly. These rapid growth genes\\xa0\\nare turned off when there is enough of you.\\xa0\\xa0 When your oncogenes get corrupted,\\xa0\\nthey basically turn on again. The third crucial mutation is\\xa0\\nin your cells’ suicide switch.\\xa0\\xa0 Most cells are constantly recycled and refreshed.\\xa0\\nWhen cells amass too much damage, they usually\\xa0\\xa0 notice and special genes trigger a controlled\\xa0\\nsuicide called apoptosis. If the genes that\\xa0\\xa0 control this process get damaged, cells are free\\xa0\\nto live on despite being dangerously corrupted. So if a cell becomes unable to fix\\xa0\\nthe mistakes in its genetic code,\\xa0\\xa0 loses the ability to destroy itself\\xa0\\nwhen it notices the damage, and begins\\xa0\\xa0 to grow rapidly without restraint,\\xa0\\nit turns into a young cancer cell. These cells have to be killed as quickly as\\xa0\\npossible: while they are bad at this stage,\\xa0\\xa0 they are still pretty weak and easy to\\xa0\\nkill. But if they continue to mutate and\\xa0\\xa0 increase in number, they can learn to avoid\\xa0\\nyour defenses and become a real threat.\\xa0 At any moment of your life, your immune\\xa0\\nsystem is hunting these cells. But how do\\xa0\\xa0 you identify and kill corrupted cells that\\xa0\\nseem indistinguishable from healthy ones? How to Find Cancer Well, here we come back to the proteins your\\xa0\\ncells produce and the story they tell. So if\\xa0\\xa0 for example, your oncogenes switch back\\xa0\\non, they make oncogene proteins. Your\\xa0\\xa0 immune system knows that they should\\xa0\\nnot be present if you are an adult. So to know which cells are\\xa0\\ncorrupt and which are healthy,\\xa0\\xa0 your immune system needs to know what proteins\\xa0\\nthey are making inside. To solve this evolution\\xa0\\xa0 came up with MHC class I molecules, a sort of\\xa0\\ndisplay window that makes cells transparent. Cells constantly take little samples of\\xa0\\nthe proteins they make and put them into\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of these MHC molecules,\\xa0\\nto showcase what they are doing.\\xa0\\xa0 The selection is constantly refreshed,\\xa0\\nalways giving an up to date picture. There is a whole library of proteins that\\xa0\\nare highly dangerous and should not be made\\xa0\\xa0 by healthy cells, and your immune system has them\\xa0\\nall on file. It has billions of specialized cells,\\xa0\\xa0 called T Cells, made to recognize specific\\xa0\\nproteins. If a T Cell sees a forbidden protein\\xa0\\xa0 in an MHC display window, it knows that the\\xa0\\ncell is corrupted and kills it immediately. But there is a flaw in this system. What if a cancer cell mutates and finds\\xa0\\na way to circumvent this process? All it\\xa0\\xa0 needs to do is to stop making MHC Class\\xa0\\nI molecules, and boom, it’s invisible.\\xa0\\xa0 Without display windows, the immune system\\xa0\\nis blind and can’t identify cancer anymore. Fortunately evolution found an ingenious solution:\\xa0\\xa0 The Natural Killer Cell. A\\xa0\\njudge, jury and executioner. The Killer At this very second, hundreds of millions of\\xa0\\nNatural Killer Cells are patrolling your body\\xa0\\xa0 looking for cells that have already turned\\xa0\\ninto cancer or are corrupted by a virus. Natural Killer Cells go from cell to cell to\\xa0\\ncheck for one thing: Does a cell have MHC class\\xa0\\xa0 I molecules? Does it have a display window and is\\xa0\\nit doing its duty of showing off what is going on\\xa0\\xa0 inside itself? This is so amazing because it\\xa0\\ncovers all of your bases: While T Cells look\\xa0\\xa0 for the presence of the unexpected, something\\xa0\\nthat should not be here, Natural Killer Cells\\xa0\\xa0 look for the absence of the expected, the\\xa0\\nabsence of something that should be here. The logic is: if a cell does\\xa0\\nnot have display windows,\\xa0\\xa0 it wants to hide something. And a cell\\xa0\\nthat hides something must be killed. What makes the Natural Killer Cell even more\\xa0\\nmetal, is that it is always in murder mode. It\\xa0\\xa0 patrols your body, checking cell after\\xa0\\ncell with the intention of killing it.\\xa0\\xa0 Your healthy cells have to convince it that they\\xa0\\xa0 should not die today. And a way to do\\xa0\\nthat is to have MHC class I molecules. So in summary, almost all young cancer cells you\\xa0\\nwill ever develop in your life will be killed\\xa0\\xa0 by your immune system. Ok, but if your body is\\xa0\\nthis prepared, why do we still get cancer? Well,\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes cancer cells mutate more\\xa0\\nand get much better at fighting back.\\xa0\\xa0 Cancer is a story of an arms race. An arms race\\xa0\\nthat we will win eventually, maybe with the help\\xa0\\xa0 of Natural Killer cells! Right now a number of\\xa0\\ntherapies are beginning to show amazing promise,\\xa0\\xa0 from cancer fighting vaccines, to engineered T\\xa0\\nCells and even Natural Killer cells – we will\\xa0\\xa0 look at these therapies in future videos.\\xa0\\nSo the war is not won yet, but we are on\\xa0\\xa0 to cancer and eventually it will be eliminated\\xa0\\nonce and for all – maybe sooner than we think.', \"why is the ocean salty and rivers aren't in fact most of the salt in the sea comes from Rivers but how can that be it all starts with ocean water heading out on the journey warm surface water evaporates the water vapor then Rises to condense into clouds that sometimes get carried over land where they rain down again on their way down the water droplets absorb CO2 and become slightly acidic when they Splash onto stones and soil they wash out sorts of minerals as ions and feed them into rows from there the salts travel to some lake or the ocean where they can accumulate over time after animals and plants Feast on this mineral Buffet sodium and chloride ions remain as leftovers you know them assault it's responsible for the salinity of ocean water because the ocean deposits as much salt sediment on the seafloor as Rivers feed into it the salt level stays at a stable 35 grams per liter on average rivers in turn do not accumulate salt they simply deliver the minerals in the little traces of salt to the oceans and lakes what goes in comes out [Music]\", \"the universe is magnificent and vast hundreds of billions of galaxies trillions of stars and even more planets if even the tiniest fraction are habitable then the universe should be teaming with life and yet we see nothing only vast to emptiness where is everyone else the answer to this riddle could be as exciting as it is creepy we are early born before almost all other life but very soon this may change not only might aliens appear they could quickly surround us an irreversible competition for the universe might be about to [Music] begin while this video is based on scientific papers we're presenting interesting ideas based on little data and lots of extrapolation so take them with a grain of Sal okay we need to look at three essential questions to understand the galactic competition one how fast can bacteria build spaceships to become a starfaring civilization Life as we know it needs to master a number of very hard steps it starts with dead stuff turning into the building blocks of life then it needs to organize into self contained cells those cells have to learn to work together to form multicellular organisms this keeps going until complex creatures with big brains learn to use tools and language civilization has to be formed from cultures that value progress and technological development and then they need to actually venture out beyond their home planet on Earth life appeared basically as soon as the oceans formed but then it took 2 billion years to make the step from single cells to multicellular organisms and 2 billion more for us to appear culture civilization and space travel developed super quickly though do things always take that long or was this actually exceptionally fast also passing One Step does not mean the next one is guaranteed multicellularity evolved over 25 times independently on Earth but there's only one species that builds spaceships we don't know how many steps life needs to pass and how long they take to give rise to a technological civilization but there are probably many and it's likely that on trillions of planets life has been trying for billions of years since we don't see any other technological civilizations out there it might well be that we are a rare exception we might be among the first or even the first technological civilization in the Milky Way but this is just one piece of the puzzle on top of that we may have just hit the perfect time window why does Humanity exist now now the universe is already 13.8 billion years old but it's unlikely that many other technological civilizations had a chance to appear before us because in the earlier universe life would have had a pretty hard time to emerge let alone Thrive because it was such a hostile environment early Stars constantly blew up galaxies crashed into each other and super massive black holes vomited massive amounts of radiation a enough to sterilize galaxies over and over again our son was born right at the end of this Cosmic death show the universe has never been more welcoming to life than it is now so Humanity has arrived at a very convenient spot in time maybe the earliest reasonably possible for life to thrive what about the future the sun burns brighter than 90% of the stars in our galaxy and will keep getting brighter in about a billion years it will boil all of Earth's oceans and then become a giant that swallows it whole so in the galactic context the sun is very shortlived most stars are red dwarves that can sustain habitable planets for tens of trillions of years life on these planets has an incredibly longtime window to appear and pass the hard steps even knowing nothing about how rare or common life is this makes it way more likely for technological civilizations to appear sometime in the the future than in the past because if civilizations appear at random in the Milky Way within a Time window of a trillion years then very few if any would appear before today then a couple more arrive in this period of a billion years that we're in before all starfaring civilizations that could ever exist emerge all together this weird tsunami like distribution is the result of both the hard steps model and something else a sort of deadline for any space fairing civilization any civilization coming after will find it hard to have room to survive so all potential life has to cram in before it Humanity exists now because otherwise we might have missed this deadline what or who creates this deadline why aren't aliens already on Earth humans are curious expansionist and hungry for we've spread over the world and made it our own our technology has been improving over time first slowly then breathtakingly fast if these things don't change drastically and our descendants want to prosper they will expand into space we could construct a Dyson SW for Endless energy and transform planets into new homes we could cross Interstellar distances allowing us to reach for planets around distant Stars if we have the most motivation we can become a Galactic Civilization a civilization that does this sort of stuff can be called Loud because its activity creates noise signs that can be detected from far away imagine someone in a forest cutting down trees starting fires and laying down roads the more intense their work the easier they are to notice an expanding technological civilization would probably be hard to miss our telescopes would pick up all that energy and we would clearly identify artificial interference with stars and planets another consequence of this business is that it's very disruptive to the environment clearing a forest means the end of its Wildlife human activity has left no chance for a squirrel civilization to appear not because we hated squirrels it's simply that the thought that they might want to do that at some point never crossed our minds and we needed work similarly if loud civilizations were running around the G in the past terraforming planets or harvesting the energy of stars they may have prevented our existence had aliens started colonizing Earth while we were still sludge in the oceans that sludge would never have turned into humans this is how loud aliens create a deadline for new civilizations appearing the Galaxy may have trillions of years to create life but there may only be a short window for it to spread and Thrive even if a loud civilization respects planets with natural occurring life and expands around them like humans do with Wildlife reserves any civilization on such a planet would not be able to expand ever trapped Forever on a tiny Island but here we are so loud aliens will probably never he what about aliens that don't expand they would be quiet aliens they're probably limited to one star system and don't have a noticeable impact on their Cosmic surroundings humanity is like this right now we wouldn't be able to detect ourselves from the other side of the Milky Way if they stay quiet forever maybe because of their culture or abilities then they are not really a concern for us we only have one sample to draw from humanity and right now we are on the path to becoming loud if we're not special and succeed anyway then any other civilization with the motivation and resources to would eventually expand Beyond its planet of origin oh okay what are the consequences of all these assumptions and ideas grave consequences race to the Stars if we are really early then eventually others will catch up with us civilizations will emerge all over the place and these new aliens will look at space see no signs of life and come to the same conclusion they exist because loud civilizations have not yet taken over everything but it only takes one loud civilization to crowd them out of the entire Galaxy they like us will face an important decision do they stay quiet take it easy and tend to their planet for as long as possible or do they start expanding to take a chunk of the Galaxy before someone else arrives meeting others does not necessarily mean War or conflict but it means that new borders will arise limits that may persist forever in the worst case a civilization could be completely enveloped by the empires of other eternally doomed to be a galactic Backwater without control over their fate so if we want to seat at the galactic adults table we best get to work if we really are early we have an incredible opportunity to mold thousands or even millions of planets according to our vision

We are among the\\xa0\\xa0 largest sciency channels on Youtube and still a\\xa0\\nbit of a black box to people. So let us talk about\\xa0\\xa0 ourselves a bit in three parts: Our backstory, how\\xa0\\nwe finance our work and the values of Kurzgesagt! Let’s jump to a more innocent time. From humble beginnings to Today Kurzgesagt’s foundation was laid when Philipp, our\\xa0\\nfounder, dropped out of high school as a teenager.\\xa0\\xa0 Learning seemed daft and useless and he was not\\xa0\\ninterested in anything. Until a very special\\xa0\\xa0 teacher at a school for dropouts grabbed him\\xa0\\nby the neck. The way she taught was different.\\xa0\\xa0 She talked about connections and the big picture.\\xa0\\nShe told a story. For the first time ever,\\xa0\\xa0 Philipp wanted to learn more without being\\xa0\\nforced. It was a key life experience. Kurzgesagt tries to recreate this\\xa0\\nexperience for you. Nothing is\\xa0\\xa0 boring if you tell a good story\\xa0\\nand we try to tell these stories,\\xa0\\xa0 to spark excitement and make you\\xa0\\nwant to go on and learn more. Because of the one teacher that could do\\xa0\\nthis, Philipp got a high school degree,\\xa0\\xa0 studied history and design and eventually\\xa0\\nstarted Kurzgesagt as a passion project,\\xa0\\xa0 inspired by Crash Course World history. In 2012 Youtube was less commercial and more\\xa0\\nidealistic. You couldn’t make a living with\\xa0\\xa0 videos as involved as ours and that was fine.\\xa0\\nThe goal was creative freedom and so for the\\xa0\\xa0 first few years, it actually cost money to\\xa0\\nmake Kurzgesagt. We had no outside funding,\\xa0\\xa0 just intrinsic motivation and a few friends from\\xa0\\nuniversity. We worked for clients during the day\\xa0\\xa0 and on Kurzgesagt at night, 80-100 hours a week.\\xa0\\nIt was a real struggle but also very rewarding. But then Patreon launched, sponsorships\\xa0\\nstarted, our views increased, Youtube\\xa0\\xa0 changed. In 2015 the channel began to\\xa0\\nbreak even and then to earn a profit.\\xa0\\xa0 But we were pretty burned out at this\\xa0\\npoint, so we decided to bring in more\\xa0\\xa0 friends and hire the first team members\\xa0\\nfull time, creating a legal entity. More people meant that we could stop overworking,\\xa0\\ndo more and improve. But we also needed to earn\\xa0\\xa0 more; the livelihood of real humans depended\\xa0\\nupon it. None of us had any experience in\\xa0\\xa0 running a company. We didn’t plan to become\\xa0\\nbig or to grow – it sorta just happened. A decade later Kurzgesagt is\\xa0\\nnot a small project anymore.\\xa0 We are an animation studio, with offices\\xa0\\nin Munich and Berlin. We need computers,\\xa0\\xa0 monitors, tablets, desks, coffee, contracts,\\xa0\\npay licences, taxes, rent and insurance. In 2023 our team consists of over 60 full\\xa0\\nemployees and a lot of freelancers around\\xa0\\xa0 the world. Salaries alone cost millions\\xa0\\nof dollars a year, just to stay around. This creates an interesting problem:\\xa0\\nwith such high production costs,\\xa0 how can we publish our work for free? How we finance Kurzgesagt We have added up our earnings from 2015 through\\xa0\\n2022. Our sources of funding change depending on\\xa0\\xa0 opportunities and the state of the world. Early\\xa0\\non, agency work was our main source of income,\\xa0\\xa0 ad revenue varies, in some years we got\\xa0\\nmore sponsorships than in others. The shop\\xa0\\xa0 didn’t exist for a long time, then it became\\xa0\\npretty big after we launched our calendar. 62% of our revenue comes\\xa0\\nindirectly or directly from you:\\xa0\\xa0 You watch our videos with ads, support\\xa0\\nus on Patreon or buy from our shop. The single biggest source of income by far, is\\xa0\\nour shop that alone accounted for 40% over the\\xa0\\xa0 last 8 years. The shop started small but once we\\xa0\\npublished our calendar for the first time in 2016,\\xa0\\xa0 we realised it could really help us do more\\xa0\\nthings and we started producing more and\\xa0\\xa0 more science products, from our posters to our\\xa0\\ngratitude journal or universe scented candles.\\xa0\\xa0 YouTube ads accounted for 13% and Patreon 9%.\\xa0\\nSo without your support we would cease to exist. Our shop and Patreon are our most important\\xa0\\nsources of revenue, and because we see ourselves\\xa0\\xa0 as science communicators – we don’t just do\\xa0\\nmerch, but sciency products that we spend\\xa0\\xa0 hundreds of hours researching, discussing with\\xa0\\nexperts, polishing up and working on directly\\xa0\\xa0 with the manufacturers. They are part of the\\xa0\\nscience story we try to tell. It also just feels\\xa0\\xa0 good to get directly funded by you guys and give\\xa0\\nyou something back for it, on top of our videos.\\xa0\\xa0 YouTube ads are a crucial part of our funding\\xa0\\nas well, but they are not within our control. Then there is paid agency work, which we\\xa0\\nstopped doing in 2022 – it accounted for\\xa0\\xa0 9% of our revenue over the last 8 years. A\\xa0\\nlot in the beginning, not much by the end. Then there are commercial sponsors\\xa0\\nadvertising products -they accounted\\xa0\\xa0 for 12% of our revenue. We also\\xa0\\ngot about 7% from German Public\\xa0\\xa0 Broadcasting for the German Channel,\\xa0\\nbut ended this partnership in 2022. Finally there are institutional sponsors\\xa0\\nrepresenting about 10%. Some people take\\xa0\\xa0 issue with this – especially Bill Gates has come\\xa0\\nunder public scrutiny, and we’ve been criticised\\xa0\\xa0 for even working with organisations funded by\\xa0\\nhim. So let us look at this 10% in more detail: About 3% of our revenue over the\\xa0\\nlast eight years came from the Gates\\xa0\\xa0 organisations for a wide variety\\xa0\\nof topics, often suggested by us. 5% comes from Open Philanthropy and is only\\xa0\\nused for specific projects. With these funds,\\xa0\\xa0 we have started Arabic, Hindi, Korean, Japanese,\\xa0\\nPortuguese, and French channels, bringing more\\xa0\\xa0 free science content to more people. Then there is\\xa0\\na two-year funding for original Tik Tok content,\\xa0\\xa0 which gives us freedom to explore and learn\\xa0\\nhow to do short form science communication. The final 2% came from other organisations\\xa0\\nlike the red cross or the UN for example. We choose institutional sponsors\\xa0\\ncarefully but if organisations\\xa0\\xa0 want to fund videos that help us spread\\xa0\\nquality information about relevant topics,\\xa0\\xa0 this is an easy yes for us, if we have\\xa0\\nthe capacity for it. On top of that,\\xa0\\xa0 the institutional sponsors we are\\xa0\\nworking with align with our values. We have contracts with every grant giver or\\xa0\\nsponsor that bars them from editorial influence,\\xa0\\xa0 other than suggesting topic areas like\\xa0\\n“global health” or “climate change”.\\xa0\\xa0 We agree on video topics together, but\\xa0\\nsponsors can neither influence details, nor\\xa0\\xa0 our conclusions. The final decision always remains\\xa0\\nwith us. And usually, we develop the topics of the\\xa0\\xa0 videos autonomously and tell the sponsor what\\xa0\\nwe are doing afterwards. If you are interested\\xa0\\xa0 in how we research our videos in detail, our\\xa0\\nhead of research wrote an article about it. Running an educational youtube channel is a\\xa0\\nbalancing act that we take very seriously. We\\xa0\\xa0 are doing our best to maintain this balance,\\xa0\\nadjusting whenever necessary. As a team and\\xa0\\xa0 company we want to grow to give more people\\xa0\\naccess to a science based outlook on the world. This brings us to our final topic\\xa0\\n– why are we doing Kurzgesagt? Our Values and Our Vision Our core mission is to spark curiosity. We\\xa0\\nwant to make science and humanism accessible\\xa0\\xa0 for as many people as possible. The effort\\xa0\\nwe put into creating our videos is a way of\\xa0\\xa0 achieving that – our videos are beautiful\\xa0\\nbecause that helps to spark curiosity,\\xa0\\xa0 to understand complex topics, and because\\xa0\\nit just feels good to create and watch. Our research is as intensive as it is\\xa0\\nso our videos are a good simplification\\xa0\\xa0 of very complicated topics. We want\\xa0\\nto make people excited about science\\xa0\\xa0 so they rediscover subjects they hated\\xa0\\nin school and see how amazing they are. On top of curiosity, we want to inspire long term\\xa0\\nthinking and a positive, constructive outlook.\\xa0\\xa0 Being optimistic about the future of humanity\\xa0\\nis not mainstream and we think this is horrible.\\xa0\\xa0 Pessimism often sounds smart and\\xa0\\ngets more views while optimism can\\xa0\\xa0 sound naive but this is a bias that\\xa0\\nis not helpful for us as a species.\\xa0\\xa0 So despite the gloominess of many topics,\\xa0\\nwe want to approach them with informed and\\xa0\\xa0 well researched optimism – not brushing\\xa0\\nhumanity's very real challenges aside,\\xa0\\xa0 but also not falling into the trap of pessimism.\\xa0\\nWe want to inspire you to dream a little about\\xa0\\xa0 the glorious future that we could actually\\xa0\\nbuild – but only if we believe it is possible. In the long run we don’t only want to do this\\xa0\\non Youtube. The idea is for Kurzgesagt to be a\\xa0\\xa0 positive influence across more media. On our\\xa0\\nTik Tok channel, in the long form content we\\xa0\\xa0 are exploring, in apps, in the VR game that will\\xa0\\nbe released later this year and the games we plan\\xa0\\xa0 to make in the future. Our shop is a central part\\xa0\\nof this vision: we start our stories with a video\\xa0\\xa0 and end them with a pos\\nter. There are so many things we want to do. And\\xa0\\nthanks to you watching this right now, we have\\xa0\\xa0 the freedom to work to the best of our knowledge\\xa0\\nand ability. In the end, we hope you like what\\xa0\\xa0 we offer and that we will be doing something\\xa0\\nworthwhile for as long as we exist. And hopefully,\\xa0\\xa0 we’ll have a lasting impact by making science and\\xa0\\nlearning more fun for as many people as possible. If you personally want to help us do this, you can\\xa0\\nwatch and share our videos, check out our shop,\\xa0\\xa0 become a patreon or give us an ad blocker\\xa0\\nexception. We exist because of you and\\xa0\\xa0 you have no idea how much we appreciate that\\xa0\\nyou are here. And hopefully we are less of a\\xa0\\xa0 black box now. In any case. Doing Kurzgesagt\\xa0\\nfor a decade has been a pretty crazy ride.\\xa0\\xa0 So from the whole team – Thank you so\\xa0\\nmuch for being with us all these years.\", \"There is this idea floating around that what\\ndoesn’t kill you, makes you stronger. That surviving a disease leaves you better\\noff. And it seems to make sense because we have\\nall experienced this. When you go through hardship, often you come\\nout more resilient, more ready to face a difficult situation in the future. But it turns out that sometimes, what doesn’t\\nkill you makes you weaker. So, what happens when you get sick? The Machinery of War Think of yourself as a large country, with\\na sizable army to defend it. You are surrounded by enemies that want to\\ntake your land, your energy, your resources. This is a matter of life and death, so your\\nbody evolved to be sensitive to damage and to the presence of enemies. Because this means that an invasion might\\nhappen at any moment and that it has to act fast. Let us start an invasion and see what happens. The moment your cells notice that something\\nis off, they release an onslaught of signal proteins called cytokines. They are like air raid sirens that activate\\nall sorts of immune cells, that then themselves release many more cytokines, amplifying the\\nalarm. Soon you are flooded with signals that trigger\\nprecautions and counter-measures. Mobilization is under way. Your brain activates sickness behavior and\\nreorganizes your body's priorities to defense. The first thing you notice is that your energy\\nlevel drops and you get sleepy. You feel apathetic, often anxious or down\\nand you lose your appetite. Your sensitivity to pain is heightened and\\nyou seek out rest. All of this serves to save your energy and\\nreroute it into your immune response. You become a country under attack switching\\ninto a war economy, because properly activating your immune system is intensely disruptive\\nand draining. Just like war is expensive for a country as\\nindustry switches to building tanks, your immune system demands huge amounts of energy,\\namino acids and micro elements to build its weapons. Take fever: it speeds up your metabolism and\\nmakes your cells work harder and faster, while creating heat that is pretty stressful for\\nmany invaders – but it uses up a lot of calories to maintain. Then your immune system begins to clone millions\\nof specialized immune cells to respond specifically to the enemy infecting you. B Cells produce millions of antibodies every\\nsecond, each requiring hundreds of amino acids to construct. Billions or even trillions of proteins need\\nto be made to refresh the complement system, a minefield inside your blood. Cytokines, the mobilisation and information\\nsignals, also need constant refreshing. Usually you acquire your resources by eating. But when you are sick, your body slows down\\nyour digestion because it needs a lot of energy you can’t spare. So it reaches for the easiest source of amino\\nacids and starts breaking down your muscles. All that muscle that you worked so hard for\\nis sacrificed to keep you alive. If you are young and healthy and fit, you\\nwill make up for that quickly once you are better. But if you are old or very young, weak or\\nsuffer from chronic illness, this may be way too draining. Your body is literally consuming itself to\\nkeep the defense going. If your whole system is already strained,\\nwhen you get sick, just keeping your immune responses going can overwhelm your capacities. Your Immune System is a Jerk. Our enemies too. Your immune system is as dangerous to you\\nas it is to enemies. There is a very fragile balance between the\\ndamage caused by an infection and the collateral damage caused by immune cells. One of your first responders are Neutrophils\\n– imagine crazy aggressive chimps with machine guns. If a Neutrophil encounters enemies it showers\\nthem with chemicals that cut them open but can also damage civilian cells, especially\\nif the patient is already compromised, for example by smoking. On top of that the microorganisms that invade\\nyou often release chemicals and toxins that can cause significant damage and cell death. So a serious infection often causes many tiny\\nwounds, literally holes in your organs. As you can imagine it is not great to have\\nholes and wounds in your organs, and your body rushes to close them. Your Neutrophils and Macrophages help by releasing\\nchemicals that signal the body to start repairs, and most of the damage is quickly filled up\\nwith regrowing cells. But others are filled with collagen, a sort\\nof fix-all organic cement that gives your gooey tissue structural integrity. You have seen the result on your skin as scars. A scar is different from the original tissue. It has no functioning cells in it, it is like\\na sloppily applied cement patch. It can’t do what the original tissue was\\ndoing. A scar on your heart makes it beat a tiny\\nbit weaker. A scar on the lungs no longer captures oxygen. A scar on your liver makes it a worse filter. And so, as you go through life and survive\\nserious disease after serious disease, the functionality of your organs may decrease. This damage is usually small enough not to\\naffect your quality of life – but can be permanent. Ok, this sounds depressing, but there is actually\\nsomething you can do to avoid a lot of this damage and train your immune system! The best way to train your Immune System Your immune system is unique. Everyone has a slightly different immune system\\nthat’s stronger against some enemies and weaker against others. Which makes evolutionary sense, as this protects\\nour species from being wiped out by a single infection. Collectively, the immune system of the human\\nspecies is a spectrum: most people respond well enough to an infection, a few are super-responders\\nand a few don't respond well and die. Some people survived the black death, are\\nmore resistant to HIV or Corona virus or even resistant against Ebola. Others are killed easily by the flu or highly\\nvulnerable to certain bacterial infections. Where you are on this spectrum is impossible\\nto predict. And you also respond differently to every\\npossible infection. This is why seemingly very healthy young people\\ndied from Covid while for some elderly people it was more like a mild flu. The idea that you can weather all sorts of\\ndiseases if you never get a cold is wrong. You never know what your immune system is\\ngood at until it is tested. Getting sick is a gamble in life’s casino\\nwith your health on the line. Always. But there is something you can do: hacking\\none of the best features of your immune system. When you survive a disease, usually you have\\nbetter defenses against it afterwards – you gain memory cells that are very good at killing\\nthe specific enemy you fought that day. So you either don’t get the disease again\\nor the next infection is much milder. And you can use an incredible achievement\\nof human ingenuity that taps into this mechanism to prevent damage from disease and train your\\nimmune system: Vaccines. Vaccines basically pretend to be a disease\\nand train your defenses to be ready if it ever shows up for real. The goal is to create the same memory cells\\nthat you would get after surviving an infection. But if you can feel some side effects, why\\nshould you still do it? Nature Vs Vaccine Dojo You have two options to train your immune\\nsystem: Vaccine Dojo and nature dojo. In vaccine dojo you train with paper weapons\\nand learn to defend yourself. Sure, you might get a black eye or a bruise. Sometimes after a vaccine, you get sick for\\na few days, but that’s generally it. No scars, no permanent damage. We discussed vaccine side effects in detail\\nin another video if you want to learn more. On the other hand, getting a disease to become\\nimmune means going to a nature dojo. In nature dojo, you train with real weapons,\\nsharp knives and swords. Things might still work out, but with way\\nmore cuts and wounds. But from time to time someone will die, be\\nit a kid from measles or an adult from influenza. Nature dojo is just way more risky. On top of that, the immunity you get from\\na vaccine is often better than the natural resistance, because they are engineered to\\nengage your immune system in a more productive way. Of course vaccines are not magic and sometimes\\nthey do not protect us as well as we’d like them to. Maybe because an enemy mutates too quickly,\\nlike the Omicron coronavirus, or because your specific immune system does not respond well\\nto the vaccine and builds less of a defense. Still, being vaccinated is one of the best\\ntools to train your natural defenses. In the end, if we look at the stunning progress\\nhumanity has made in the last century, eventually we may overcome disease for good. But until then we can do our best to take\\ncare of ourselves and others - your body and your older self will be grateful to you. Diseases are not the only problem humanity\\ncan address if we work together. We believe the same is true for climate change,\\none of the main challenges of our generation. We are very passionate about this topic and\\nwe have covered it extensively in previous videos. Humanity needs to tackle this problem on different\\nlevels of society, from governments and economies down to the individual. And there’s one way you can take action\\nnow – by working with our friends from Wren, who help you offset your carbon emissions. By visiting wren.co and answering a few questions\\nyou can find out what your personal carbon footprint is. Your first step should be reducing your footprint\\n– but there are limits to that. Wren lets you offset the rest of your carbon\\nfootprint with a monthly subscription that supports projects that plant trees, protect\\nrainforests, and remove carbon dioxide from the sky. We think it's one of many puzzle pieces that\\ncan make a real difference in the climate crisis. Once you sign up to make a monthly contribution\\nyou’ll get pictures and updates from the project you support, so you can directly see\\nthe impact you are making. We appreciate Wren’s focus on transparency\\nand impact, so you can always retrace how your money is spent. One project we find especially interesting\\nis Refrigerant Destruction — Old refrigerators use harmful gases as a coolant. These gases, once released into the atmosphere,\\ncause global warming thousands of times faster than CO2. Wren’s project permanently destroys containers\\nfilled with these gases—proving, with high certainty, that they’ll never leak and contribute\\nto global warming. Sign up through wren.co/kurzgesagt to start\\nhelping the planet. As climate change is close to our hearts we\\nwill personally pay for the first month of subscription for the first 200 people to sign\\nup!

biological robots they don't want anything they don't feel anything they are never sad or happy they just are right here right now they're as conscious as a stone or a chair or a neutron star cells just follow their programming that's been evolving and changing for billions of years molded by natural selection they are impossible machines and yet here they are driven entirely by the fundamental forces of the universe the smallest unit of life right at the border where physics becomes biology sometimes to get a truer understanding of how amazing something is you need to hold your breath and dive in really deep so what are cells and how do they [Music] work look around the room you're sitting in right now let's fill it top to bottom with trillions of grains of sand billions of grains of rice hundreds of thousands of grapes a few thousand apples and a dozen watermelons this is what the inside of your cells looks like in terms of numbers they're mostly filled up with water molecules the grains of sand water gives the cell's insides the consistency of soft jelly and enables other things to move around easily or almost all the other things the rice and fruit are proteins several billion in total more than 10,000 different kinds depending on the function of the cell your cells are basically protein robots as is all life really in fact all solid nonfat parts of your body are mostly made out of protein even your bones proteins are dead things that make life happen how does this work the language of Life cells need to do many very hard things to stay alive get food in and waste out grow and build structures Escape danger or react to stimuli make copies of themselves and so on all of this is done by speaking the language of life and the words of this language are proteins this is how this language Works in a nutshell it all begins with amino acids tiny organic molecules they're the alphabet of the language of life there are 21 different ones like different letters amino acid a amino acid b c and so on if you put around 50 amino acids together they form a protein which in the language of life is a word and if you put many of these protein words together you get a sentence called a biological pathway let's oversimplify a bit and say for example your cell needs to break down sugar with the language of life it may take the amino acids for the letters b r e a and K to form the protein word break then combine this word with other protein words to form a biological pathway sentence that means break down sugar in reality this language of life is so complex that it defines imagination you need to know about 8,000 words to speak a human language really well but in the language of life there are an estimated 20,000 and while the average English word has five letters human proteins have an average of 3 175 amino acids the longest protein has more than 30,000 and cells need to execute thousands of steps at any moment if they ever stop speaking the language of Life they die okay but how do Mindless cells speak a language this complex let's dive a little deeper there are 21 amino acids that can be combined to form proteins and proteins are made up of dozens to hundreds to thousands of amino acids for the average protein length of a human cell of 375 amino acids you get a stunning 6.8 * 10 the power of 495 possible proteins your cells can make a quadrillion Google Google Google Google times more than there are atoms in the universe most of these possible proteins are useless just like with human language most random letter combinations are just gibberish so you need to know which words which proteins make up a language to speak it properly and this is the job of your DNA a long sequence of instructions if you untangle a cell's DNA it would be about 2 m long all of your body's DNA combined into one long string would reach to the Sun and back over 20 times around 1% of your DNA is made up of genes which are basically protein dictionaries that contain all the words of the language of Life your cells speak but genes are also the building manuals for all the protein your cells need to function the rest of your DNA is probably not useless but basically like a set of rules it's like the book of grammar of the language of Life which proteins need to be built at which time how many of them do you need which protein words go together and why okay letters words sentences dictionary and grammar but of course this is all just a metaphor for something mind-numbingly complex let's dive a little deeper to catch a glimpse of reality how dead proteins make life now that we have some basic principles we have a chance to understand how dead things make life together and for that we need a fundamental force of the universe electromagnetism the elementary particles that make up atoms which make up amino acids have different charges that attract or repel each other the 21 different amino acids all have slightly different charges some are are more negative others more positive when your cells build proteins they put different amino acids together in Chains basically long strings now because of the different charges of the amino acids used these strings begin to fold in on themselves this folding process is so complex that we still haven't completely understood how exactly it works but in a nutshell 1D strings become 3D structures proteins are basically 3D puzzle pieces with a very specific shape in the world of proteins shape is everything because its 3D shape determines which areas of a protein are charged in which way and this determines how it can interact with other proteins all of these differently charged puzzle pieces can snap together or repel each other when they snap together their charge changes which can make them change their shape which then makes them a new protein a new tool that can do new things this is what makes proteins so incredibly powerful you can do basically everything with them they can snap together like Lego pieces to build complex structures they can dismantle things they can form complex micro machines that use energy to do work and maybe most stunningly they can convey information let's say there's a toxic chemical entering your cell there may be a protein shaped to snap to that toxin if the protein finds that toxin it changes its shape with that new shape it can now snap into a different protein that changes its shape again this new protein activates a micro machine that directly binds to your DNA to order the production of a special protein which acts as an antidote to the toxin this Cascade of interaction is the pathway we spoke about earlier a sentence in the language of life so without a single active thought proteins have fixed a problem and saved the cell's life in reality these Pathways can have dozens to hundreds of steps how life operates is so incredibly or inducing somehow mind-numbingly complex interactions between dumb and dead proteins create a less dumb and less dead cell somewhere around here life happens but we still don't know what life is how dumb things are smart together we need another analogy so let's talk about ants ants share a fundamental property with cells they are really dumb as single ant will just stumble around uselessly but if you put a lot of ants together they exchange information and do amazing things constructing complex structures organizing themselves caring for Broods or attacking enemies although dumb individually together they become something greater this phenomenon occurs all over nature and is called emergence it's the observation that entities have properties and abilities that their parts do not have this is how everything in Your Body Works your cells are bags of proteins Guided by chemistry but together these proteins form a living being that can do a lot of really sophisticated things cells are Mindless robots that are even dumber than ants but many of them acting together form specialized tissue and organ systems from muscles that make your heartbeat to brain cells that make you think if you look outside at the incredible Dimension and scale of space a place where for ever is a real thing it's almost impossible not to feel a bit small not special but if you look inside into what you really are you just discover almost Indescribable complexity the beautiful language of Life almost everything in the universe reveals hidden layers of complexity if you look closer and if you have the knowledge to understand it to help you with that

ever existed they burned brighter than galaxies and were larger than any Star today or that could ever exist in the future but besides their scale what makes them special and weird is that deep in sight they were occupied by a cosmic parasite an endlessly hungry black hole how is that even possible [Music] black hole Stars take the weirdness of black holes and go beyond to break everything we know about how stars form and grow they were only possible during a short window of time in the early universe but if they existed they would solve one of the largest mysteries of cosmology black hole stars were excessive anywh you look at them the most massive stars today may have about 300 solar masses a black full Star had up to 10 million solar masses of nearly pure hydrogen let's take a moment to look at what this means visually the sun weson LL pegasi the largest star and finally the black hole star its scale is beyond words over 800,000 times wider than our sun 380 times larger than the largest star we know today and Far Below its surface is a black hole growing rapidly as it devours billions upon billions of tons of matter per second normally Stars Are Born from gigantic clouds collections of thousands or millions of solar masses of mostly hydrogen in these clouds matter starts to accumulate around the densest spots inside as these spots get denser their gravitational pool intensifies and they grow faster eventually they generate so much heat and pressure that they ignite Fusion reactions and a new Star is Born but this puts a limit on their size nuclear fusion releases enough radiation energy that the surrounding gas cloud is blown away the new baby star can't gather more Mass from now on the star is living on the edge between two forces gravity pulling in trying to squash the star and radiation created by Fusion pushing outwards trying to blow the star apart after millions or billions of years is the core runs out of fuel and the balance brakes destroying the star but black hole stars were very very different the beasts of the early Universe a few hundred million years after the big bang when the universe was much smaller all the matter in existence was much more concentrated the universe was much denser and hotter Dark Matter was a dominant player forming giant structures called Dark Matter halos these dark matter Halos were so massive that they pulled in and concentrated unimaginably gigantic amounts of hydrogen gas becoming the birthplaces of the first stars and galaxies epic clouds of hydrogen formed some as massive as 100 Million Suns more than the mass of small galaxies in this unique environment that will never exist again the enormous gravitational pull of the Dark Matter Halos Drew gas into its Center and created extremely massive stars as we said before when A Star is Born it blows away the gas cloud that created it but these Titanic gas cloud in the early Universe was so large and massive that even after their birth more and more gas piled on the newborn star making it grow to unbelievable proportions the young star is forced to grow and grow and grow getting more and more massive until in some cases it reaches up to 10 million times the mass of our sun crushed by gravity its core gets hotter and hotter desperately pushing outwards trying to blow itself apart but to no avail there's too much mass and too much pressure the balance is impossible to uphold like a supernova run fast forward the core gets crushed into a black hole normally that would be the end today stars go supernova a black hole forms and things calm down but in this case the star survives its own death a tremendous explosion rocks the star from the inside but it's not enough the star is so large and massive that not even a supernova can destroy it but now it has a black hole for a heart it's tiny a few tens of kilometers in the center of a thing the size of the solar system the monster grows Stars Are Born from ever faster spinning and collapsing gas and so they also spin when a black hole is born from the core of a star it keeps its angular momentum this means that matter that gets drawn in doesn't just fall in a straight line but instead begins orbiting the black hole in smaller and smaller circles going faster and faster the result is an accretion disc where gas orbits at nearly the speed of light only a small amount of gas actually falls in at any given moment basically black holes put a lot of food on the table and only nibble at it but the matter trapped in the accretion disc doesn't have a good time friction and collisions between particles heated up to temperatures of millions of deg actively feeding black holes have accretion discs that are incredibly hot and Powerful this heat from the disc further restricts how much a black hole can devour just like the core of stars the super hot material creates radiation that blows away most of the food within its reach so even if a black hole had access to as much food as it desired it can only grow slowly a black hole embedded inside ins a black hole star is different the enormous pressure surrounding it pushes down matter directly into the black hole overcoming all restrictions on how fast it can consume this process is so violent and releases so much energy that the accretion disc becomes hotter and releases more radiation pressure than any star core ever could enough to push back against the weight of 10 million Suns an impossibly dangerous balance has been created millions of soda masses pushing in the angry radiation of a force-fed black hole pushing out for the next few million years the black hole star is consumed from within the black hole grows to thousands of solar masses and the bigger it gets the faster it eats which heats up the star even more and causes it to expand in its Final Phase the black hole star has become over 30 times wider than our solar system truly the largest star to ever exist in the the universe the intense magnetic fields at its core spew out Jets of plasma from the black hole's poles which Pierce through the star and shoot out into space turning it into a cosmic Beacon it must have been one of the most a inducing SES to ever exist in the universe but this also marks the end it becomes too stretched and the accretion disc within too powerful the parasite destroys its host blowing it apart a black hole hole with the mass of 100,000 Suns rips its way out to hunt for new prey while leaving behind nothing but a star carcass the super massive question if black hole Stars existed they could explain one of the greatest Mysteries of the universe the super massive black holes we see at the center of galaxies are just too big they shouldn't be possible black holes born from regular supernovas can be a few tens of solar masses at most and because of the process we explained before they grow slowly after that if black holes merge they can form slightly larger black holes of over a 100 solar masses it should take billions and billions of years to make black holes with hundreds of thousands or even millions of solar masses and yet we know that some super massive black holes already had 800 million solar masses only 690 million years after the big bang black hole stars are a sort of black hole cheek coat if they formed very early in our universe and the black holes that emerged from them were thousands of solar masses then they could be the seeds for super massive black holes these seeds could take root in the center of the earliest galaxies merging with others and drawing in enough matter to grow quickly and reliably very soon we may be able to verify their past existence the James web Space Telescope is turning its sens is to explore the farthest reaches of the universe looking back in time back to the early universe that we couldn't see before so with luck we might be able to witness glimpses of these tragic Titans in the brief moment between their formation and destruction until then let's do the visual Journey again just for fun stars are big black hole Stars bigger [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music]\", \"Mars is a disappointing hellhole lacking\\xa0\\npractically everything we need to stay\\xa0\\xa0 alive. It looks like we’ll only ever have small\\xa0\\ncrews spend a miserable time hidden underground.\\xa0\\xa0 Except, we could terraform it into a green\\xa0\\nnew world. But to solve the planet’s problems,\\xa0\\xa0 we first need to make it worse and turn it\\xa0\\ninto oceans of lava with gigantic lasers. This isn’t a far-fetched science fiction tale.\\xa0\\nTerraforming Mars is possible, on the kind of\\xa0\\xa0 time scale our ancestors built great monuments\\xa0\\nin. If humanity solves some of its pressing\\xa0\\xa0 problems and ventures into space to expand into\\xa0\\nthe solar system, this may not be that far off. Ok. So how do we terraform Mars\\xa0\\nquickly? Well, It’s complicated. Mars is dry and has no soil to grow anything. Its\\xa0\\natmosphere is too thin to breathe or protect from\\xa0\\xa0 radiation, giving you a high risk of cancer.\\xa0\\nSo to turn it into a new home for humanity,\\xa0\\xa0 we have to give it a proper atmosphere, similar\\xa0\\nto Earth’s. It should be made of 21% oxygen,\\xa0\\xa0 79% nitrogen and a tiny bit of CO2, at an average\\xa0\\ntemperature of 14°C and under 1 bar of pressure. We have to create oceans and rivers and then the\\xa0\\nground has to be weathered into fertile soil to\\xa0\\xa0 host living things. Then we need to install\\xa0\\na biosphere on the surface and prevent it all\\xa0\\xa0 from being undone by installing protective\\xa0\\nmeasures that can stand the test of time. It’s difficult. But a big\\xa0\\nlaser makes it a lot easier. Challenge 1: The Atmosphere Some 4 billion years ago Mars had a nice\\xa0\\noxygen-rich atmosphere and was home to vast\\xa0\\xa0 oceans and rivers. It held onto it for\\xa0\\nseveral hundred million years before it\\xa0\\xa0 got blown away. Ultraviolet rays broke down\\xa0\\nthe atmospheric gases and then the oceans,\\xa0\\xa0 until they were swept away by solar wind.\\xa0\\nToday Mars is a dry, barren wasteland. Luckily a sizable portion of the water is frozen\\xa0\\nin deep reservoirs and in the polar ice caps,\\xa0\\xa0 enough to create a very shallow ocean.\\xa0\\nAnd enormous amounts of oxygen are bound\\xa0\\xa0 as minerals in the Martian rocks,\\xa0\\nlike the oxygen in the iron oxides\\xa0\\xa0 that give the planet its rust-red colour,\\xa0\\nas well as carbon dioxide in carbonates. To free these gases, we need to\\xa0\\nreverse the reactions that lock\\xa0\\xa0 them away by using thermolysis,\\xa0\\nwhich occurs at temperatures as\\xa0\\xa0 high as on the surface of the Sun. In\\xa0\\nshort, we want to melt Mars’ surface. The best way to do that would be to put lasers\\xa0\\nin orbit aiming their beams down on Mars.\\xa0\\xa0 The most powerful laser today is the ELI-NP,\\xa0\\xa0 able to produce beams of 10 Petawatts\\xa0\\nof power, for a trillionth second. To melt Mars we need a laser twice as powerful,\\xa0\\nthat runs continuously. The easiest way is to use\\xa0\\xa0 a solar-pumped laser that can be powered directly\\xa0\\nwith sunlight: At its core are metal-infused glass\\xa0\\xa0 rods that absorb energy and release it as a laser\\xa0\\nbeam. If we build an array of mirrors in space,\\xa0\\xa0 about 11 times the size of the United States, we\\xa0\\ncan focus enough sunlight onto them to melt Mars. Let’s do it! As the lasers hit the surface, about 750\\xa0\\nkg of oxygen and some carbon dioxide emerge\\xa0\\xa0 from every cubic meter of rock melted. If\\xa0\\nwe are efficient our lasers only need to\\xa0\\xa0 melt through the top 8 meters of\\xa0\\nthe surface to get enough oxygen. It would look terrifying. The\\xa0\\nskies would be shrouded in storms,\\xa0\\xa0 while the ground would glow red-hot,\\xa0\\ncriss-crossed by currents of lava.\\xa0\\xa0 Tireless laser beams sweep over the landscape,\\xa0\\nleaving trails too bright to look at. After they\\xa0\\xa0 pass, the ground cools quickly. A strange\\xa0\\nsnow falls: the ashes from all the elements\\xa0\\xa0 that solidify as they cool down, like silicon and\\xa0\\niron. Mars is still a cold planet at this point. A happy side effect of this inferno is that\\xa0\\nall the water in the polar ice caps and even\\xa0\\xa0 deep underground rises into the sky as hot\\xa0\\nsteam, forming clouds that rain down over\\xa0\\xa0 the entire planet. They would wash out\\xa0\\nthe nastier gases from the atmosphere,\\xa0\\xa0 like chlorine, and carry away harmful elements\\xa0\\nthat accumulated on the surface. In the end, they\\xa0\\xa0 would form shallow oceans, saltier than on Earth.\\xa0\\nWe might need to do an extra clean-up afterwards. It would take about 50 years of continuous\\xa0\\nlasering to create our oxygen atmosphere. We\\xa0\\xa0 could use this opportunity to dig deeper in some\\xa0\\nplaces to create the basins for salty oceans or\\xa0\\xa0 rivers and spare some landmark features\\xa0\\nlike Mons Olympus and Valles Marineris. We’re not done though. The resulting atmosphere is nearly 100%\\xa0\\noxygen and only 0.2 bar. It’s hard to\\xa0\\xa0 breathe and very flammable. To make\\xa0\\nit similar to earth and a lot safer,\\xa0\\xa0 we need to add a lot of nitrogen, which\\xa0\\nMars is lacking sadly. We have to import it. The ideal source is Titan, a large moon of Saturn,\\xa0\\ncovered in a thick atmosphere that’s almost\\xa0\\xa0 entirely nitrogen. We just have to move 3000\\xa0\\ntrillion tons from the outer solar system to Mars. While that’s not easy, it is doable. To\\xa0\\nprocess that much of Titan’s atmosphere,\\xa0\\xa0 we have to construct giant automated factories,\\xa0\\non its surface powered by our lasers to suck in\\xa0\\xa0 the atmosphere and compress it into a liquid.\\xa0\\nThis gets pumped into bullet-shaped tanks,\\xa0\\xa0 which a mass driver shoots all the way to\\xa0\\nthe red planet, where they explode and mix\\xa0\\xa0 with the oxygen. We’ve already been able to send\\xa0\\nindividual missions to Saturn in just a few years.\\xa0\\xa0 With enough resources, it should be possible\\xa0\\nto complete the task within 2 generations.\\xa0 Of course it would be much more\\xa0\\nconvenient to have nitrogen left\\xa0\\xa0 over from terraforming Venus on the side: we\\xa0\\nexplained this in detail in another video. So, about a century after the\\xa0\\nstart of the terraforming process,\\xa0\\xa0 we have a breathable atmosphere that has\\xa0\\nthe right gases. If the liberated CO2\\xa0\\xa0 isn't enough to warm it up to temperatures we\\xa0\\ncan stand, we just add some super greenhouse\\xa0\\xa0 gases. Mars at this point resembles a\\xa0\\nblack marble from all the cooling lava,\\xa0\\xa0 spotted with growing oceans and red patches\\xa0\\nwhere the old surface remains untouched. It’s\\xa0\\xa0 still a wasteland, no better than a desert\\xa0\\non Earth. We need to fill it with life. Challenge 2: Biosphere Installing a biosphere on a new planet is\\xa0\\nvery difficult. Unexpected interactions\\xa0\\xa0 between species or sudden diseases can\\xa0\\ndestabilise it to the point of collapse. We would probably begin by seeding our young\\xa0\\noceans with phytoplankton. Without competition,\\xa0\\xa0 it would bloom rapidly, filling up the oceans\\xa0\\nto become the bottom of an aquatic food chain.\\xa0\\xa0 They can be followed by tiny zooplankton,\\xa0\\xa0 then by fish. Maybe even sharks and whales. If\\xa0\\nthings go well, life in the oceans will thrive. Life on land is harder. Plants need\\xa0\\nnutrient-filled ground to sink their roots\\xa0\\xa0 into. But most of the surface is the congealed\\xa0\\nremains of lava and ashes. We could wait for\\xa0\\xa0 thousands of years for water and wind to grind it\\xa0\\ndown into finer sands or try to do it manually. But we want to be quick. And we have a\\xa0\\nbig laser. Turning the beam on and off\\xa0\\xa0 in rapid succession would cause the ground to\\xa0\\nquickly heat up and contract, which breaks it\\xa0\\xa0 into smaller and smaller pieces. Add a bit\\xa0\\nof water, and you get a sort of dark mud. Into this mud, we can mix fungi and\\xa0\\nnitrogen-fixing bacteria. They’re\\xa0\\xa0 able to absorb nitrogen and convert it\\xa0\\ninto nitrate compounds to feed plants.\\xa0\\xa0 The first plants we want to bring are\\xa0\\nnative to volcanic islands on Earth,\\xa0\\xa0 since they are perfectly suited to\\xa0\\nthe laser-blasted Martian landscape. Eventually, the enriched mud becomes the\\xa0\\nfoundation for grasslands and forests. In\\xa0\\xa0 Mars’ lower gravity, trees can become very tall\\xa0\\nvery fast. Their roots gather the nutrients\\xa0\\xa0 they need and then dig deeper to turn more rocks\\xa0\\ninto soil, forming a self-sustaining ecosystem. At this point we can slowly introduce more plant\\xa0\\nvarieties, insects and animals. Not mosquitoes\\xa0\\xa0 though. The new biosphere needs to be maintained\\xa0\\nto prevent it from falling out of balance. If\\xa0\\xa0 plants grow too quickly and absorb too much\\xa0\\ncarbon dioxide, the planet cools down too much.\\xa0\\xa0 If key species die out, we could see populations\\xa0\\ncollapse faster than they could recover. On Earth,\\xa0\\xa0 other species would move in to fill the void,\\xa0\\nbut our Martian biosphere is not as flexible. It takes hundreds if not thousands of years\\xa0\\nbefore Mars becomes a stable environment. But eventually the planet will have the potential\\xa0\\nto sustain large human colonies. With air,\\xa0\\xa0 water and food available, we\\xa0\\ncan finally call Mars – black,\\xa0\\xa0 blue and green – our home. A\\xa0\\ngiant, volcanic island in space. Will it last though? Challenge 3: The long-term future There is a problem we haven’t addressed: Mars’\\xa0\\ncore does not produce a magnetic field, so it does\\xa0\\xa0 not have enough protection from solar radiation\\xa0\\nor cosmic rays. This becomes dangerous for the\\xa0\\xa0 long term health of Martian populations. So as a\\xa0\\nfinal step, we need an artificial magnetic field. It doesn’t have to be huge like Earth’s. It\\xa0\\xa0 just needs to deflect the solar wind\\xa0\\nenough so that it doesn’t touch Mars. The easiest way is to construct a magnetic\\xa0\\numbrella far ahead of Mars that splashes the solar\\xa0\\xa0 wind to the sides. A big, superconducting ring\\xa0\\npowered by nuclear facilities is all it takes.\\xa0\\xa0 It would orbit at the Mars-Sun L1\\xa0\\npoint, keeping it constantly in\\xa0\\xa0 between the Sun and Mars and protect\\xa0\\nthe new atmosphere. And that’s it! Terraforming Mars would take some work,\\xa0\\nhefty resources and probably a century or\\xa0\\xa0 ten but it would be the first time\\xa0\\nwe’ve lived in a home designed and\\xa0\\xa0 shaped solely by us and for us. A first\\xa0\\nstep towards our future among the stars.\", \"everything changed when the slaver Nation attacked what used to be a thriving colony is now a captured country slaves do the work serving their new Masters until they die only to be replaced by new victims harvested in brutal raids but let's go back to the [Music] beginning the world war of the ants is ging millions of lives every day but in the brutal world of ants straight up war is not the only way around 50 ant species practice slavery the most extreme division of labor we don't know how this began but some ant species perfected this cruel trade meet polyergus the most intense of the slaver ant tribes there are different species but generally they're 4 to 10 mm long with brown to blackish bodies and sickle shaped mandibles polyergus has specialized in slavery so much that they've lost their ability to care for themselves they don't clean build nests care for their brood or feed themselves they only exist for raiding slaves make up 82 90% of the ants in their colonies so a few hundred polyergus and a single queen control thousands of slave ants we'll summarize and simplify what we know about pogus into one Grand Story you can find find more information in our sources so now let's witness the cruel banality of nature The Raid it all begins on a mild Summer Morning on a sunny field witness this colony of over 10,000 for Mica ants genetically cousins of polyergus who build a thriving Nest underground they are a widespread genus some species are good Fighters some great Builders and some cattle Farmers often welcomed by humans because they hunt Vermin that hurt forests nobody noticed the lone polya Scout that briefly showed up this morning before she bolted away again the attack begins in the early afternoon the Scout returns from her mission to find the for Mica nests she dances erratically and spreads pheromones that excite and mass recruit more and more rants until a large raiding party of a thousand Warrior 's has formed a close-packed well organized column up to 10 m long begins to move as the polyus raiding party arrives at the for Mica Colony the attack begins almost immediately dozens of attackers begin digging and clearing up debris from The Nest entrance to make it easier to storm as soon as they're done hundreds of the attackers Rush inside the Defenders vastly outnumber their attackers and are formidable Warriors able to shoot AET but instead of fighting back effectively they seem confused and Scatter rather than fighting back Urus also seems to be somewhat resistant to the acid sprays of the Defenders and so even if a defense is forming the attackers use their mandibles to pierce and kill there are a few different ideas as to why polyus attacks are so efficient and one of the most fascinating ones is chemical warfare instead of relying on Brute Force they release a propaganda pheromone that makes the Defenders Panic unable to mount an organized defense the attackers have nothing to gain from intense and toand combat other than immense casualties what's more they actually want their victims to survive so that they can be raided again in a few weeks as the raid unfolds the attackers breach deep into the colony looking for their most valuable possession The Colony babies they grab the pupy and na'vi that will make up the next generation of for Mica and carry them out of the nest hundreds are abducted and brought back to the polyus colony in this rate alone well most of them a few unlucky ones are eaten as a sort of snack the surviving victims will be turned into slaves after about an hour The Raid is over and the for Mica can begin to recover it seems their only strategy is to make even more ants a decent sized Colony can forfeit thousands of PE in a single raiding season and still survive although in this case while the raid was going on something even more Sinister happened hold that thought though because how are polyergus turning ants into slaves how to brainwash ant slaves ants conquered almost the entire planet over 100 million years ago they owe their success to being social animals that perfected chemical communication chemical signals and cues let ants know what their colony needs and what each individual should do and most importantly in this case who is a friend or Foe slave making ants are much less social than other ant species some species miss a lot of the genes other ants have to make communication possible in a sense they are bad at talking to each other so it may be that as polya's ancestors started to abduct other ants they lost the ability to collaborate and work together productively soon after the stolen for Mica Offspring have been brought to the slaver Colony they are progressively covered in polyergus pheromones they are chemically imprinted similar to a duckling who imprints on a Mother after birth when the New Slaves hatch they behave as though they are part of the polyus colony and begin to work for them unconditionally keeping the nest clean caring for the next generation of slaves and Masters hunting for food and feeding their enslavers mouth to mouth this sort of brainwashing goes so far that if they encounter free for M ANS in the world they will treat them as enemies in a sense they're not true slaves as they serve willingly and show no interest in Freedom it's more more like violent abduction and adoption which doesn't make things that much better and as the forer only live for a few months a constant new supply of victims is necessary to survive polyus can never stop enslaving how to make new slave colonies how are new polyergus colonies created after all polyergus workers are so useless that a queen can't start a new Colony without slaves but how does she make slaves without Warriors it turns out there are two main strategies the more dangerous one might unfold during a raid like the one we witnessed before a young polyus Queen silently follows the raiding party using the chaos of the invasion she's able to find her way to the for Mica Queen and kill her taking over the shaken Colony although such a victory may be very shortlived poly ogers do not tolerate other slaver colonies within their hunting ground they raid each other fiercely too and can destroy the competing colon is nearby so while this tactic sometimes works it is pretty dangerous another young Queen is going for a different strategy she's looking for a formica Colony that is further from her birthplace attacking a whole Colony on her own she bols through an entrance pushing aside confused ants that try to stop her releasing a powerful appeasement pheromone that drives Defenders away she has only a short time window to find the for Mica Queen deep in the Hostile Nest once she finds her Target both Queens engage in a fight to the death The polyergus Queen Is Well equipped with her sharp Mandall she bites and rips into her victim for about half an hour before she finally calms down between her bites she licks the chemical surface of the Dead formica Queen covering herself in her pheromones when she's done with this macabra ritual fora workers approach her subdued by her intense smells they start grooming and feeding her as though pledging their allegiance to their new ruler she still might not be done though for mic colonies often have multiple Queens who all need to be defeated which is not guaranteed often attacking Queens will be stopped by a falance of workers that rip her apart or are defeated in royal battle but if she does manage to kill all the Queens The Colony has been taken over and the enslaved brood will begin to serve a new Queen the usurper she now begins laying eggs that are cared for by her New Slaves until New polyergus ants hatch that will soon start new raids on neighboring colonies no matter what we humans do quietly below our feet the world war of the ants is Raging with wild and horrible strategies fought by billions of individuals every single day polyergus will continue to hunt for slaves as to stop raiding would be their demise and in the war of the ants there is no giving up\", \"supern noi are the most powerful explosions in the universe unleashing enough energy to outshine galaxies we have no real metaphor for their power if the sun were to magically go supernova it would feel like you were being hit by the energy of a nuclear explosion every second for weeks while supern noi are the engines of creation forging the elements that enable life they also burn sterile whole regions of galaxies so what would happen if if one hit [Music] Earth there are roughly speaking two ways to make a supernova either the core of a massive star implodes or less common a white dwarf gains Mass to the point where it ignites explosive nuclear fusion the outcome is the same a supernova explosion when we think of an explosion on Earth we think of something that happens fast and ends but a supernova is more likely volcanic eruption followed by a tsunami at first there's a colorful ball of hot expanding gas creating a spectacular Cloud that will shine for about a month but then it doesn't stop hot and dangerous gas rushes outwards at speeds of 10,000 km a second through the near vacuum of space sweeping up the sparse gas of the Galaxy this wall of gas expands for tens of thousands of years and will eventually span up to dozens of light years until it finally cools off and disperses its substance back into the Galaxy so what if this star tsunami hits us well the damage depends on how far away it is stage one thousands of light years away humans have witnessed dozens of supern noi but all of them were thousands of light years away they appeared as new stars some outshining the moon twinkling for a few weeks and disappearing aside from looking very pretty at this distance they don't do much to us stage two 300 light years away things begin to get a bit icky once a supernova occurs around 300 light years away we can expect one this close to us every few million years a single star giving the night sky an eerie glow like Twilight and while this is far enough away and dim enough to not do harm to us they can affect the Earth at these distances it's like being hit by the last weak waves of the star tsunami not strong enough to do real damage but still noticeable in fact we know that over the past 10 million years multiple supern noi have struck Earth from these distances because we can find radioactive isotopes of iron deep in the rocks and sediments at the bottom of the ocean amazingly these Supernova around the solar system have cleared a 1,000 Lightyear wide pocket of space that's called the local bubble they blew away the interstellar gas and dust creating a lumpy wall of gas that's now a cradle for Star formation stage three 150 light years away once a supernova happens much closer than 300 light years we're approaching the Zone where it does real damage stars have extremely powerful magnetic fields when they die the tsunami of dead star actually retains a lot of this magnetic energy woven through the shock wave that expands outwards in this highly magnetized Cloud we get like in a huge particle accelerator that's accelerating charged particles like protons nuclei and electrons to immense speeds which means we have an expanding Cloud that is shooting deadly radiation in all directions long after the bright light from the initial explosion has faded away if a supernova happens too close by waves of these cosmic rays will wash over the solar system for thousands of years while we're mostly protected on Earth's surface by the atmosphere and ozone layer the influx of extra radiation will still increase cancer and mutation rates not enough to cause a mass extinction but it will be noticeable space flight would become impossible in the solar system as astronauts wouldn't survive the waves of radiation for long we don't know exactly how bad this would be but a supernova that is close enough May trap our species on Earth for Generations maybe thousands of years it only gets worse from here stage four closer than 100 light years within 100 light years things get bad as a supernova disrupts our climate in ways that we don't fully understand yet there are a few unpleasant things happening all one after another first the high energy photons arrive from the explosion followed by many decades of radiation from the radioactive tsunami both of which seriously damage the ozone layer Earth's shield against harmful radiation the ozone layer absorbs ultraviolet radiation by breaking apart ozone o03 into O2 and a free oxygen atom which later reforms back into another ozone molecule but the Supernova radiation breaks up nitrogen molecules that gobble up the free oxygen breaking the cycle and depleting the ozone layer quickly without a radiation Shield everybody living on the surface is exposed to very high levels of UV radiation from our sun cancer rates would Skyrocket and just going outside during the day could be life-threatening the extra radiation would also kill a lot if not most of the plankton in the oceans that live near the surface and are the basis for the marine food chains leading to a mass extinction worse still Supernova radiation would ionize gas in the atmosphere which means that it would punch through molecules and knock electrons off nuclei leaving them charged these charged nuclei then act as seeds for water vapor to gather and form massive Global clouds in the worst case they would reflect enough sunlight to trigger an ice age in fact it's thought that the Ice Age 2 and A2 million years ago was caused by a supernova some scientists even think that a supernova about 60 light years away might have been the cause of the devonian mass extinction 350 million years ago but wait there's more the electrons punched free by the radiation form enormous electric Avalanches or in other words lightning Earth is hit by some of the worst thunderstorms in millions of years the intense lightning causes global wildfires that consume forests and crops devastate cities disrupt our electrical grids and Global Supply chains all while a decimated ozone layer leaks deadly radiation while in the past the ecosystem may have bounced back from a nearby Supernova after a few thousand or million years there's no guarantee modern civilization can take a hit of this magnitude we would face food shortages skyrocketing prices and Wars as Nations struggle to not be consumed by chaos so a supernova this close would at the very least do significant damage for hundreds or thousands of years if not end our modern civilization and with it millions or even billions of lives still Humanity would likely survive and could recover stage five closer than 25 light years a supernova closer than 25 light years means that we're in its kill radius where a mass extinction is all but guaranteed probably about half of the ozone layer would be destroyed and massive climactic disruption on a scale we've never witnessed would ravage Earth entire ecosystem systems would swiftly be wiped out by radiation AS Global wildfires envelop the planet all the things described before happen but way more intensely and much faster a few people might survive for years in bunkers if they have food supplies but the world they return to will be devastated and hostile to life for hundreds of thousands of years human extinction is extremely likely final stage four light years being any closer to a supernova is very unlikely because space is big but the effects would be extreme even from 4light years away the distance to Alpha centuri a supernova would be almost as bright as the sun in the sky while casting two Shadows could be fun for a few hours within days the Earth's surface gets as hot as a sauner baking the surface for weeks until the explosion Fades the surface of Earth Burns scared of life even the oceans aren't safe the massive amount of radiation that follows Burns away the ozone layer killing everything that sees sunlight it would be the largest Extinction event in history reducing life to a few survivers in the deep sea and critters in the Deep soil life basically has to start over conclusion how worried do you need to be so should you worry no fortunately there are only a handful of stars that may explode within 1,000 light years of Earth and none are close enough to be a serious threat even better better these Stars will probably not go supernova for many millions of years so you are safe but there's no guarantee for the far future as stars orbit the Galaxy our descendants may find themselves dangerously close to a supernova but by then a far more advanced and wiser Humanity will hopefully be able to just move out of the way in any case you can sleep well tonight under the beautiful night sky\", \"here in the kotart labs we test very important ideas to see what happens when you blow things up or play with black holes many of you suggested that we look into an idea that sounds reasonable shooting nuclear waste into space it's one of those Concepts that seems like an easy fix for one of the main problems with the nuclear energy but it turns out this idea is not just bad but horribly bad and it gets worse the longer you think about it why is that [Music] what is nuclear waste nuclear waste is a fuzzy term and comes in categories which vary from country to country but in general there are three broad levels 90% is lowlevel nuclear waste tools gloves or trash used at a nuclear facility that could be weakly contaminated with some short-lived radioactivity this stuff is generally safe for normal disposal 7% is intermediate level nuclear waste mostly materials that have been in close proximity to a reactor core long enough to become dangerously Radioactive with proper handling it's either safely buried or melted down and mixed into glass or concrete and stored deep underground so 97% of nuclear waste is similar to toxic byproducts from other Industries not great not terrible we can handle it the remaining 3% is where our problems begin highlevel nuclear waste is very concentrated spent fuel taken out of a reactor core formerly uranium it's now made of various dangerous and often highly radioactive elements as a bonus it's also incredibly hot and not easy to handle at all this is what we want to shoot into space All In All Around 440 active nuclear reactors create about 11,000 tons of high level nuclear waste each year since 195 54 we've accumulated 400,000 tons of dangerous radioactive waste most countries are dealing with it by not dealing with it and kicking the can towards the future great so let's launch it into space according to scientists space is big and nobody lives there so it seems perfect for yeting away this mess there are a few tiny problems though problem one stuff ain't cheap even though space light is getting more affordable it's still extremely expensive just to get something into low earth orbit costs on average about $4,000 per kog putting that into perspective it costs about $1,600 to mine separate and fabricate 1 kg of nuclear fuel so launching waste into space has suddenly made nuclear fuel for reactors way more expensive and greatly increased the cost of the electricity they produce to launch one reactor worth of nuclear waste would cost at least $100 million per year to deal with all the 440 operational nuclear power plants high level nuclear waste would cost some $44 billion per year for space launch before packaging transport and security costs are added okay let's pretend we don't care currently we couldn't shoot all the nuclear waste into space even if we wanted to there just aren't enough rockets in 2021 we saw a record 35 launches into space if we repurposed each of those rockets and filled them all with nuclear waste the total amount that could be lifted into a low earth orbit which is the closest orbit above the atmosphere is nearly 800 tons we'd need at least 14 times more Rockets to handle just today's nuclear waste let alone get rid of the hundreds of thousands of tons in temporary storage we would need to create entire new Space Industries to keep up with the demand for giant toxic Space trash trucks and it gets worse problem two space is hard we only made the calculation for low earth orbit where we send most of our rockets and satellites littering the space around Earth with thousands of cks of spent nuclear fuel would be a nightmare for space junk management and satellite collision avoidance worse still at this altitude there's still a little bit of atmosphere causing a tiny bit of drag so we might have nuclear waste raining down from space within just a few years experts would call this a huge problem clearly we have to launch our waste further if we wanted to send it to perhaps the moon we either need way more Rockets or we need to build much bigger ones making it even more expensive a single Saturn 5 the rocket used by the Apollo program which cost around 1.5 billion adjusted for inflation per launch could get about 43.5 tons from the earth to the moon so we'd need about 260 Saturn f rocket launches every year and of course using the Luna's target practice for nuclear waste tipped Rockets kind of makes a huge mess so maybe don't aim for anything space is empty do we really need a target shooting waste in any random direction is you guessed it also a bad idea orbits are Loops which means they have a tendency to come back to where they started put enough in the sky in random directions and you'll get one back eventually so we'd want to launch our nuclear waste deep into space which means we need even bigger rockets that would be even more expensive not that we would be completely safe then Earth might run into these interplanetary caskets at some time in the far future and experience a pretty meteor shower made from radioactive dust okay how about we shoot it into the sun ironically the sun is pretty hard to hit while the sun has very strong gravity everything on Earth is moving with respect to the Sun including the rockets that we launch meaning a rocket would have to cancel out all the orbital motion it has around the Sun so it can stop orbiting and fall in because of this it's actually easier to launch a rocket entirely out of the solar system than it is to launch it into the Sun but to do either of these things we need even bigger Rockets probably the biggest we've ever built H nothing works the thing is it gets even worse problem three rockets go rocket engineering has taken huge steps since the Apollo era we've made them relatively safe we've mostly replaced the toxic explosive cancer fuels of the past decades with much sailor mixes of liquid oxygen and hydrogen or kerosene the newest designs even land themselves so that they can be reused and yet out of the 146 launches in 2021 there were 11 failures which means that a sizable number of our Rockets carrying high level radioactive waste would be exploding on the Launchpad or in the worst case disassembling at high altitude or crashing from Hypersonic speeds each failure would be at least equivalent to a miniature Noble but instead of being contained under a slab of concrete spread throughout the atmosphere radioactive particles could make their way to far away places by riding on the winds most would fall into the ocean but some would land on the inhabited parts of the world they could cover farmlands and get concentrated into our food or enter our water supply which is well bad imagine regular large- scale nuclear disasters happening people wouldn't be happy conclusion and opinion part nuclear waste is scary but the fear of it and horrible ideas like shooting it into space reveals how bad we are at understanding risk because the largest amounts of radioactive elements Like Ur ium and radon are actually released by coal burning millions of tons of coal each year leaves Ash as a waste product that includes about 36,000 tons of radioactive materials less radioactive than high level nuclear waste but there's also a lot more of it and it's handled way less carefully some of this ash is caught by filters but most is simply pushed back into leaky mines shoved into piles exposed to the wind or poured into ponds that regularly spill into rivers and Lakes living within 1.6 km of an ash pile increases your cancer risk up to 2,000 times over the acceptable limit and this is on top of other toxic chemicals like heavy metals and of course their massive CO2 emissions and yet while nuclear energy is flawed and its current form may only be a transitory technology nuclear power plants are a harder cell than coal nuclear waste and the lack of willingness to deal with it are a real issue it's not not insurmountable though there are good methods to handle it like burying it deep underground or reprocessing some of it into new fuel but however we ultimately deal with this issue we hope one thing is clear shooting nuclear waste into space is one of the worst ideas ever researching this crazy thing conducting all of these important tests and of course creating this video took us around 2,000 hours which is insane for a

Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find No Escape but up currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface Earth's crust is the only thing in their way it feels solid to us but it's only a fragile barrier an apple skin around the claiming Behemoth true apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined subjecting the climate to centuries worth of change in a single year while drowning continents in toxic Ash and gases super volcanoes how big can they get and will they put an end to humanity [Music] volcanoes there are many types of volcanoes from towering mountains to lava domes but they have two main sources the first is at the boundaries between tectonic plates the pieces of the crust that cover the Earth like a giant jigsaw puzzle there are seven major tectonic plates and dozens of smaller ones drifting against each other at up to 15 cm per year this sounds slow but on geological time scales it is a Titanic struggle over who gets to stay on the surface the winning plate crumbles into a new mountain range while the loser is shoved underneath into an ocean of hot rock at 1300° C the asthenosphere the temperature here is enough to melt rock into a liquid but the insane pressures of all that mass keep it a superheated solid tectonic plates are usually in contact with water for thousands of years and absorb some of it when they're submerged into the hot underworld this water triggers chemical Transformations that allow tiny portions to melt into magma liquid magma is less dense than Solid Rock so it rises to the surface in Furious bubbles that accumulate in sponge-like reservoirs right under the crust if enough magma accumulates it becomes powerful enough to pierce through the crust which we experience as volcanoes this happens under the winning plate like a Revenge attack by the loser before it's erased forever the second main source of volcanoes are thought to be mantle plumes these are columns of abnormally hot rock that rise all the way from the planet's core mantle boundary to the surface much less is known about them but in a way it's as if the Earth's mantle has weather patterns and mantle plumes are a little like hot air rising to form storm clouds storms hundreds of millions of years old made of rocks circulating at a rate of a few millimet per month they don't care about the motion of tectonic plates so they can break the crust to create volcanoes in the middle of nowhere that stubbornly stay active as the crust shifts around them the volcanic boom meter scientists love to put big booms on a scale and came up with a logarithmic scale that measures the volume ejected during an eruption the volcanic explosivity index or VII simply put it starts really small and gets very big very quickly a vii2 eruption would fill 400 full Olympic swimming pools with lava we have around 10 of these per year at vii3 we already see devastating effects like the eruption of the samaru volcano in 2021 that destroyed thousands of homes in Indonesia at vii5 we see catastrophic amounts of materials cubic kilometers of debris equivalent to an entire Lake of molten rock blasted into the air like the 2022 hunga Tonga hunga haai eruption that sent a shock wave around the globe many times and created ocean white tsunamis at a VII of six an eruption can change the world in 1883 the Indonesian island volcano katoa erupted nearly continuously over the course of 5 months one of those eruptions blew it apart producing the loudest sound recorded in history 10 trillion times louder than a Rocket taking off heard Halfway Around the World 30 m High tsunamis Swept Away nearby populations and so much gas and Ash were released the global temperatures cooled by nearly 0.5° C red Dusty sunsets followed for many years at vii7 we get super colossal eruptions Millennium defining events that human civilization has only encountered a handful of times Mount tamboro was a 4,300 m high mountain until it exploded in 1815 and released 400 times more energy than the tar bomber 140 billion tons of Ash and dust was shot halfway to space before smothering the world's skies turning them a sickly yellow there was no summer the following year crops died and over a 100,000 people perished this is the Dreadful potential of volcanic eruptions with famines across the other side of the world and even centuries Long Cold periods being attributed to them okay but what's a super volcano the term super volcano is a meteor invention and not a scientific term the main issue with them is that not every eruption from a super volcano is a super eruption what makes super volcanoes special is that they've been waiting to erupt for hundreds of thousands of years pressure buil up in colossal magma reservoirs several kilometers deep until it becomes strong enough to lift the rock Above It by several meters rocks crack under the pressure until they finally give way and billions of tons of gas and Ash blast out at supersonic speed an insane explosion of at least 1,000 cubic km that impacts every corner of the globe and yet that is only a small portion of the magma Reservoir super eruptions are like a Boiling Pot of water popping its lid off and spitting a bit off the top afterwards the ground collapses into the void Left Behind forming a hole called a Caldera under this Caldera pressure starts building again until the volcano gathers enough energy for another Super eruption but this could take hundreds of thousands of years it's estimated that one of the few volcanoes capable of super eruptions on Earth could cause a catastrophic eruption every 177,000 years on average that would make them far more frequent than comparable asteroid impacts the most recent super eruption is the orui eruption 26,500 years ago in New Zealand with the force of dozens of billions of tons of TNT a Mount Everest sized pile of explosives a huge portion of the landscape was scooped out and thrown into the atmosphere left behind a Caldera spanning 20 km and it caused the entire southern hemisphere to undergo a period of abrupt cooling though among super eruptions it's a mere Firework the lake Tober eruption of 74,000 years ago was a much more significant turning point in history it released a gargantuan 5,300 Cub km of material enough to blanket parts of South Asia in 15 cm of Ash and trigger a rapid 4° C drop in global temperatures it's possible that the volcanic winter lasted 10 years followed by worldwide droughts for centuries Earth's climate might have not recovered for a thousand years the largest volcanic events we know of were not really huge explosions but floods of millions of cubic kilm of lava the grand finale with a Siberian traps around 250 million years ago a continuous release of lava for 2 million years they raised the ocean temperatures to over 40° C which caused the permium Triassic Extinction killing over 90% of all species Earth's surface needed 9 million years to recover these sorts of eruptions don't change the climate they are the climate but thankfully we haven't seen anything even remotely close to that scale in many millions of years so should you be scared of super volcanoes definitely not they've been used to frighten many people and are overhyped as an unavoidable apocalypse the most famous One Yellowstone will erupt again but they will be relatively small eruptions natural disasters for sure but not enough to devastate the us or come close to ending Humanity the chance of a vi8 eruption in the next few hundred years is less than 2% and more importantly it wouldn't come as a sudden surprise however less powerful but more frequent eruptions can also do serious damage to our civilizations and are in many way ways a much greater concern so we must watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs like ground swelling and temperature increases to get an early warning that can save the lives of people living the closest to a volcano and there's time to develop solutions that can remove sulfur and Ash from the stratosphere to eliminate the root cause of the climate disruption we've seen from previous eruptions who knows maybe we'll even be able to turn this force of Destruction into an agent for Good by exploiting the geotherm energy held in their giant magma reservoirs we've done this work for so many other disasters and we are already doing things we could only have dreamed about decades ago like sending a probe to perform our first asteroid redirection test with determination Humanity really can solve anything so while deep below us an angry hell is churning and waiting for its moment you can sleep well tonight\", 'The universe is pretty big and very strange. Hundreds of billions of galaxies with sextillions\\nof stars and planets and in the middle of it all there is earth, with you and us. But as enormous as the universe seems looking\\nup, it seems to get even larger when you start looking down. You are towering over worlds within worlds,\\nwithin worlds – each in plain sight and yet hidden from your experience. Let’s go on a journey – we’ll start\\nin a park, about a thousand meters long, enough for a 15 minute walk. Every time we click this magic button, we’ll\\nbecome a thousand times smaller. Please slip into this magic science suit,\\nso you don’t die and can still see. Ready? Let’s go. click The Miniature Realm You are the size of a grain of sand just 2\\nmm high, standing on a blade of grass that seems as tall as an eight storey building\\nto you. A square meter of lawn is now a dense metropolitan\\narea, with 100,000 blades, or two Manhattans worth of grass towers. From your new tiny perspective, the park that\\nyou could quickly stroll through before, is now the size of France. Crossing it would take at least a week. Human sized humans loom over you, 4 times\\ntaller than the Empire state building, their steps falling from horizon to horizon. A bee the size of a helicopter lands near\\nyou, making the ground shake, as its hairy carapace vibrates with each wingbeat. You try to escape but are barely able to move\\nbecause the air is so… gooey. Before you clicked the button air resistance\\nwas barely noticeable – but as you’re now a thousand times smaller, it is as if\\nthe air has become a thousand times denser. It feels like you are moving through honey. Flying insects like bees use this to their\\nadvantage. Their wings are not made for gliding but like\\npaddles that row through the air. Scaled up to human size, the bee would outrun\\na Concorde Jet – except it couldn’t even take off because it would be too heavy for\\nits wings. click The Microscopic Realm You’ve entered the microscopic realm and\\nare now less than 2 micrometers tall, about the size of an e coli bacteria. From your new tiny perspective, the park you\\nstarted in is now a million kilometers wide to you – if you walked non stop it would\\ntake some 25 years to cross it. It is hard to grasp just how huge the microscopic\\nworld is to its tiny inhabitants. The giant bee that was close a moment ago,\\nis now the size of Mt. Everest, towering high into the sky – but\\nalive, humming and vibrating. The air here feels almost solid to you, on\\nthe human scale it would be as viscous as lava, extremely hard to push through. The blade of grass now expands so far you\\ncan’t see its edges, stretching as wide as Paris would to a regular sized human. You see valleys that look like dried up riverbeds,\\ndead patches like deserts and giant craters left behind by voracious aphids. But if you look closely, this is not terrain. These are rows of individual cells, each the\\nsize of a house with hard exteriors like glass shells. Every few cells, there are huge openings called\\nstomata, like mouths, sucking in air and blowing out oxygen. Suddenly the gigantic bee begins to move – a\\nconstruct made of rigid pieces that slide against each other, like a suit of armor. It takes off to escape a drop of water the\\nsize of an Asteroid, that fell from another blade of grass and is now rushing at you at\\nbreathtaking speeds. You brace for impact but instead of feeling\\na strong punch you just get sucked in. You try to swim but the water feels thick\\nand sticky and holds onto your limbs like glue. Air molecules are free spirits while water\\nmolecules act more like social creatures that group together whenever possible. They pull on each other and create a relatively\\nstrong cohesive force that traps you. You can’t help it but you are still moving,\\ntumbling in all directions, helplessly dragged along by an invisible current. Floating in this miniature lake are tens of\\nthousands of micro-organisms. They take on many forms – viruses the size\\nof tennis balls float around you aimlessly, others like the Euglena oxyuris cells which\\npass you like freight trains. But most look like oily jellyfish the size\\nof a car, sporting long tentacles that act like super charged propellers. Despite the water holding onto them like glue,\\nsome move hundreds of body lengths per second, equivalent to a person shovelling through\\nmud at over 600 km/h. However bacteria weigh so little and water\\nis so viscous that they basically have no inertia – there is no gliding on this scale. The result is a weird jerky motion that’s\\nhard to keep track of. Maybe we can learn more about this strange\\nmotion if we go even deeper. click Molecule Realm You’ve become the size of a molecule, just\\nunder two nanometers wide. At your new tiny scale, the droplet now seems\\nas big as the Moon to a regular human. The blade of grass it rests on could reach\\nfrom the tip of Alaska to the end of Australia, and the park is now almost the size of the\\nSolar System – but instead of mostly empty space, it is filled with stuff. Everywhere you look, there are innumerable\\namounts of molecules and atoms. The rigid walls of the grass cells beneath\\nyou are clearly vibrating, rippling with waves of energy. The water droplet contains nearly a sextillion\\nwater molecules that are all in motion. Water is actually a storm of H2O molecules\\nsmashing into each other hundreds of trillions of times a second. Each of them is moving at speeds of around\\n2300 km/h and bombard their surroundings mercilessly, sending small objects hurtling in all directions. This is the source of the invisible current\\nthat you noticed when you were a thousand times larger. Scaling this speed up to the human scale is\\nimpossible, as a human sized molecule would be 2000 times faster than the speed of light. All this furious motion comes from heat. Heat is a bit abstract at our human scale,\\nwhere you touch something and get a vague sense of whether it is hot or cold. But down here, you really feel what ‘heat’\\nis: the motion of molecules, vibrating, twisting and colliding as if they’re inside a furious\\nballpit. When these molecules lose heat, they move\\nmore slowly and collide less often. When they gain heat, they speed up and smash\\ntogether with renewed fervour. Temperature is basically the measure of the\\naverage speed of these fantastic dancers performing all day. Suddenly a molecule hits you especially hard\\nand you are catapulted out of the water droplet into the air again. And here you see something unexpected: The\\nstuff between the air molecules: Nothing. Between the molecules that make up the air\\nthere is a vacuum. On average a molecule in the air travels for\\nabout 60 nanometers, which is about the length of a hockey rink if it were the size of a\\nhuman. If we were to compress all the molecules and\\natoms buzzing around in the room you are watching this in, they would only fill about 0.1% of\\nits volume. 99.9% of the space around you is a vacuum,\\nyou just don’t notice it. Which also means that every time you take\\na breath, you breathe in mostly nothing with a few atoms. Click Subatomic Realm At your size of under 2 picometers, scale\\nstarts to lose its meaning. A human would be nearly 2 billion kilometers\\ntall relative to you, so large they could stretch their arms from the Sun to Saturn. An atomic nucleus would be the size of a grain\\nof sand you could hold on the tip of your finger. That grain holds 99.97% of the atom’s mass. The rest, a sphere of influence about as large\\nas the Eiffel tower from your perspective, is filled with an electron cloud. That’s basically all the places where electrons\\nmight be at any given moment in time. Electrons are shapeshifters that morph around\\noutside a nucleus, creating a new and vibrating mess of different shapes with every new moment. Unlike the graceful motion of planets, the\\natomic nuclei are chaotic blurs. They bulge, roll, quiver and breathe. They hold back the same energy that powers\\nnuclear bombs and it doesn’t let them sit still.. They twist and vibrate sextillions of times\\na second. It is time to end our journey and return to… click What are you doing? click Stop it! click, click, click, click, click, click,\\nclick…. The Smallest Place (?) We have reached the bottom, the border between\\nreality and unreality. The scale here is the Planck length, which\\nis the distance light travels in a Planck Time. Planck time is the time it takes light to\\ntravel a Planck length. Ah ok. None of our models of the universe make sense\\nat scales smaller than this, so for now, this is it. Sad click :( We think that down here, particles bubble\\ninto existence and then spontaneously disappear, creating a quantum foam of unimaginable energy. Can we go even smaller? We don’t know. It is time to return. If you look up, the universe is large and\\nstrange. So incredibly large and strange. But if you look down, into the tiny and extremely\\ntiny, the universe seems even larger, and even stranger. In the end, the perfect place might be where\\nyou are right now – not too big, not too small.', \"friends make life good they provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun they give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security self-esteem and happiness almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life but maybe you have scrolled through your phone unsure who to call to go to a movie with to celebrate with or ask for comfort you may realize that you don't have enough friends and feel lonely and it's not just you disconnectedness and loneliness are widespread many people want more close friends but don't know how to get them surprisingly nowadays loneliness is highest among young people whose relationships were also hit especially hard by the global pandemic social distancing stopped teens and young adults from mingling in classrooms clubs or dorms millions of friendships may be lifelong friendships that might have blossomed will never exist with profound long-term consequences for our Collective happiness the good news is that it's not too late and there are lots of friends to be found we'll mix scientific information with actionable advice in this video but we can't address every individual situation people cultures and schedules are different if you suffer from chronic loneliness you can also watch the video we made about it okay as with all important things in life making friends is infuriatingly simple but not necessarily easy but it works through a few pretty straightforward mechanisms the most important thing about making friends people make friends with other people when they spend casual time together this is how our ancestors formed their relationships because humans lived in small close-nit communities in which options for making friends were limited so we just formed good relationships with the people who were around us this is why it's so easy to form new friendships in school and University Society locks you and your peers in a building for several years you share similar activities but more importantly similar schedules overlapping and fluctuating Social Circles form naturally giving you regular FaceTime and shared experiences with many different people time to find others with similar World Views or senses of humor proximity can be more important than similar interests one study found that in student dormitories the distance between rooms was the strongest fr ship predictor living closer together meant a higher chance of becoming friends another study showed that being physically present in a class A Lot without saying a word makes others more sympathetic to you so the most important principle of making friends is to regularly spend time with people in the real world this alone can make it happen automatically and trumps all other advice but don't forget that making friends is not a numbers game or a competition don't compare yourself to others everyone has a social calibrator that can change as you go through life maybe you were more introverted as a teen but yearn for Connection in your 20s maybe you were part of sprawling Social Circles but prefer fewer friends in your 30s there is no right or wrong only right for you why we don't have enough friends the main reason for a lack of friendships is the simple fact that most people don't prioritize friendships nearly enough they don't realize until it's too late that retaining friend ships demands regular energy and attention although they are so important for happiness friends often take a backseat to other life decisions work commuting romance or kids take up so much time and energy that it's so much easier to crash on your couch and lose yourself in mindless activities especially as an adult going for a bike ride getting dinner or visiting a hobby store takes much more mental effort and commitment that it did after school when time ran slower and energy and curiosity were abundant but it's not just adults who are too busy for friends the average American Teenager spends more time on Tik Tok every day than socializing at parties events or on the phone with friends combined established friendships don't require the same time investment as early friendships to keep up but they do require some commitment as life distracts you it's easy to skip out on checking in when a friend goes through exciting or depressing times and so many friendships fade for lack of attention Often by accident which is extra tragic because there is never only one person losing a friend it's always at least two another thing that makes many people vulnerable is the way friendship networks are structured the Friendship Paradox is the phenomenon that on average most people have fewer friends than their friends which makes sense since you're more likely to be friends with someone who has many friends than with someone who has few rather than being densely interconnected friend networks are often built around central hubs so if central people disappear from your life this can deprive you of many connections at once and it can lead to a distorted self- perception that you are less popular than others although you are perfectly average it can get worse quickly with big life Events maybe you move for school work or love and are left without social networks or you had a breakup that left you with the smaller part of the formerly shared social pie the reasons why you find yourself with less connection than you want are as diver versus people but the underlying cause is almost always time there is no shortcut to make new friends and retain friendships you have to prioritize relationships spend time with people in real life and make them feel that you care so take a look at yourself and rebalance what you spend your life doing how to make new friends Studies have shown that new friendships can develop quite quickly weeks after you meet someone but it takes a few months for a casual friendship to become a close relationship with the biggest impediment being time invested and the quality of your interactions to make friends it helps if you intentionally look for people you have things in common with and who are open to new relationships you want to make it easy for yourself so examine what kind of person you are generally speaking extroverts tend to Crave sensory stimulation spicier Foods loud music or the excitement of engaging a crowd introverts often confused with shy people tend to be more sensitive to sensory stimulants and prefer quieter surroundings fewer people and even less spicy food different places attract different people not everybody can easily make friends at a bar or a football game not everybody finds a stroll through a park or a bookstore stimulating men especially form friendships around shared activities but in general it's a good idea to go to places that feel comfortable where there are people you might like who do things you find interesting look for local clubs or opportunities to volunteer check out what hobby stores are around and dust off your Space Marines or see if there are new D and D groups in your city and ask if you could join one check Meetup apps for gaming nights or wine tasting join a sports club or look for people who go hiking or want to cook together another obvious Avenue is your professional life it helps if you work in a job that attracts people like you so you might consider this when you choose a career deepening your relationship with colleagues can lead to Great friendships especially if you look for peers and there is is no power IM balance and of course there are friends you've lost touch with you may be able to revive some of these relationships in some cases all it needs is a call or an invitation research shows that more often than not the other person will appreciate that you've reached out there are likely way more opportunities to spend time with others than you are aware of and if there aren't you can take the initiative and create them invitations are signals to start friendships so bring people together by having a dinner party organizing a football game after work or starting a board game group everybody appreciates people who organize fun things and the simple Act of reaching out can Kickstart a self-propelling upward spiral of well-being fun and connectedness that can seriously improve the life of everyone around you in meaningful ways if you meet someone you Vibe with it's pretty scary to make the first move but they may feel the same way equally interested in a friendship but also blocked by fear of rejection so it's wor worth going for it worst case they're not interested which will sting for a few hours but the best case could be a lifelong friendship a risk well worth the reward once you've formed early connections check in whether they have important things happening in their life of course it's important not to be overbearing but the more time you invest the more opportunity you have to engage in meaningful banter or silly jokes the fact that friendships take time also means that you need to be patient and kind with yourself especially if you're out of practice practice things will not improve overnight but slowly step by step if you keep up open up Care and Share many people don't have an issue being around others but struggle to turn acquaintances into friends so let's talk about two important principles that make it more likely that you'll connect caring and sharing in general our favorite topic is ourselves and the things we care about because we are literally at the center of our own universe so people tend to like people who are genuinely interested in them so if you want to make friends your goal should be trying to learn what makes them tick just as important as caring about others is reciprocity and openness to connect you need to share the experiences that made you you now you don't want to overwhelm the other person and immediately spill out your deepest Secrets but open up a little and reveal personal things because this also signals to others that it's okay to do the same the best case is that you find shared experiences maybe you both had a hard time in school maybe you share a passion for weird movies learning about others and sharing personal stories in a balanced way and not overdoing it is not an exact science noticing the line between opening up and oversharing requires practice and depends on the vibe of the conversation one of the perplexities of life is that to get something it can be helpful to convince yourself that you want it less than you do in general it's good to be laidback have fun and enjoy yourself do things for yourself without expectations but also be open to social opportunities and accept invitations if they show up and that's basically it give friendships more priority in your life check in with friends and regularly go to things to have fun show genuine interest in others and give them the opportunity to know you without selling yourself too heart if you do this you're on track if this sounds a bit scary the good news is that human brains are hardwired to seek connection It's Perfectly Normal to seek out new friends and there are many people who would welcome more close relationships there are friendships up for grabs everywhere and there are plenty of people who will be so happy to have you in their life

Its\\xa0\\ncitizens enjoyed the benefits of central heating,\\xa0\\xa0 concrete, double glazing,\\xa0\\nbanking, international trade,\\xa0\\xa0 and upward social mobility.\\nRome became the first city in\\xa0\\xa0 history with one million inhabitants\\xa0\\nand was a center of technological,\\xa0\\xa0 legal, and economic progress. An empire impossible\\xa0\\nto topple, stable and rich and powerful. Until it wasn’t anymore. First slowly then\\xa0\\nsuddenly, the most powerful civilization on earth\\xa0\\xa0 collapsed. By civilization, we mean a complex\\xa0\\nsociety where labor is specialized and social\\xa0\\xa0 classes emerge and which is ruled by institutions.\\xa0\\nCivilisations share a dominant mutual language and\\xa0\\xa0 culture and domesticate plants and\\xa0\\nanimals to feed and sustain large cities,\\xa0\\xa0 where they often construct impressive monuments. Civilization lets us become efficient on large\\xa0\\nscales, collect vast amounts of knowledge,\\xa0\\xa0 and put human ingenuity and the natural resources\\xa0\\nof the world to work. Without civilization,\\xa0\\xa0 most people would never have been born. Which\\xa0\\nmakes it a bit concerning that collapse is\\xa0\\xa0 the rule, not the exception. Virtually all\\xa0\\ncivilizations end, on average after 340 years. Collapse is rarely nice for individuals.\\xa0\\nTheir shared cultural identity is shattered as\\xa0\\xa0 institutions lose the power to organize people.\\xa0\\nKnowledge is lost, living standards fall, violence\\xa0\\xa0 increases and often the population declines.\\xa0\\nThe civilization either completely disappears,\\xa0\\xa0 is absorbed by stronger neighbors\\xa0\\nor something new emerges,\\xa0\\xa0 sometimes with more primitive\\xa0\\ntechnology than before. If this is how it has been over\\xa0\\nthe ages, what about us today?\\xa0\\xa0 Just as Europeans forgot how to build\\xa0\\nindoor plumbing and make cement,\\xa0\\xa0 will we lose our industrial technology,\\xa0\\nand with that our greatest achievements,\\xa0\\xa0 from one dollar pizza to smartphones or\\xa0\\nlaser eye surgery? Will all this go away too? Today our cities stretch for thousands of\\xa0\\nsquare kilometers, we travel the skies,\\xa0\\xa0 our communication is instant. Industrial\\xa0\\nagriculture with engineered high yield plants,\\xa0\\xa0 efficient machinery and high potency fertilizer\\xa0\\nfeeds billions of people. Modern medicine gives\\xa0\\xa0 us the longest lifespan we’ve ever had, while\\xa0\\nIndustrial technology gives us an unprecedented\\xa0\\xa0 level of comfort and abundance – even though\\xa0\\nwe haven’t yet learned to attain them without\\xa0\\xa0 destroying our ecosphere. There are arguably\\xa0\\nstill different civilizations around today that\\xa0\\xa0 compete and coexist with each other, but together\\xa0\\nthey also form a singular, global civilization. But this modern, globalized civilization is even\\xa0\\nmore vulnerable in some ways than past empires,\\xa0\\xa0 because we are much more deeply interconnected.\\xa0\\xa0 A collapse of the industrialized world literally\\xa0\\nmeans that the majority of people alive today\\xa0\\xa0 would perish since without industrial agriculture\\xa0\\nwe would no longer be able to feed them. And there is an even greater\\xa0\\nrisk: What if a collapse were so\\xa0\\xa0 deeply destructive that we were\\xa0\\nunable to re-industrialize again?\\xa0\\xa0 What if it ruined our chances of enjoying a\\xa0\\nflourishing future as a multiplanetary species? A global civilizational collapse\\xa0\\ncould be an existential catastrophe:\\xa0\\xa0 something that ruins not just the\\xa0\\nlives of everyone alive today,\\xa0\\xa0 but all the future generations that could have\\xa0\\ncome into being. All the knowledge we might have\\xa0\\xa0 discovered, the art we might have created, the\\xa0\\njoys we might have experienced, would be lost. So, how likely is all of this? Let’s start with some good news. While\\xa0\\ncivilization collapses have happened regularly,\\xa0\\xa0 none have ever derailed the course of\\xa0\\nglobal civilization. Rome collapsed,\\xa0\\xa0 but the Aksumite Empire or the Teotihuacans\\xa0\\nand of course the Byzantine Empire, carried on. What about sudden population crashes? So far we have not seen a catastrophe\\xa0\\nthat has killed much more than 10% of the\\xa0\\xa0 global population. No pandemic,\\xa0\\nno natural disaster, no war.\\xa0\\xa0 The last clear example of a rapid global\\xa0\\npopulation decrease was the Black Death,\\xa0\\xa0 a pandemic of the bubonic plague in the fourteenth\\xa0\\ncentury that spread across the Middle East and\\xa0\\xa0 Europe and killed a third of all Europeans\\xa0\\nand about 1/10th of the global population. If any event was going to cause the\\xa0\\ncollapse of civilization, that should have\\xa0\\xa0 been it. But even the Black Death demonstrates\\xa0\\nhumanity's resilience more than its fragility.\\xa0\\xa0 While the old societies were\\xa0\\nmassively disrupted in the short term,\\xa0\\xa0 the intense loss of human lives and suffering\\xa0\\ndid little to negatively impact European economic\\xa0\\xa0 and technological development in the long run.\\xa0\\nPopulation size recovered within 2 centuries,\\xa0\\xa0 and just 2 centuries later, the\\xa0\\nIndustrial Revolution began. \\n\\xa0 History is full of incredible recoveries from\\xa0\\nhorrible tragedies. Take the atomic bombing of\\xa0\\xa0 Hiroshima during World War 2. 140,000 people were\\xa0\\nkilled and 90% of the city was at least partially\\xa0\\xa0 incinerated or reduced to rubble. But against all\\xa0\\nodds, they made a remarkable recovery! Hiroshima’s\\xa0\\xa0 population recovered within a decade, and today\\xa0\\nit is a thriving city of 1.2 million people. None of this made these horrible events any\\xa0\\nless horrible for those who lived through them.\\xa0\\xa0 But for us as a species, these\\xa0\\nsigns of resilience are good news. Why Recovery is Likely Even in the Worst Case One thing that’s different from historic collapses\\xa0\\nis that humanity now has unprecedented destructive\\xa0\\xa0 power: Today’s nuclear arsenals are so powerful\\xa0\\nthat an all-out global war could cause a nuclear\\xa0\\xa0 winter and billions of deaths. Our knowledge\\xa0\\nof our own biology and how to manipulate it\\xa0\\xa0 is getting so advanced that it is becoming\\xa0\\npossible to engineer viruses as contagious\\xa0\\xa0 as the coronavirus and as deadly\\xa0\\nas ebola. Increasingly the risk of\\xa0\\xa0 global pandemics is much higher than in the past.\\nSo we may cause a collapse ourselves and it might\\xa0\\xa0 be much worse than the things nature has thrown\\xa0\\nat us, so far. But if, say 99% of the population\\xa0\\xa0 died, would global civilization collapse\\xa0\\nforever? Could we recover from such a tragedy? We have some reasons to be optimistic.\\xa0\\nLet’s start with food. There are 1 billion\\xa0\\xa0 agricultural workers today so, even if the\\xa0\\nglobal population fell to just 80 million,\\xa0\\xa0 it is virtually guaranteed that many\\xa0\\nsurvivors would know how to produce food.\\xa0\\xa0 And we don’t need to start at square one because\\xa0\\nwe could still use modern high-yield crops.\\xa0\\xa0 Maize is 10 times bigger than its wild ancestor;\\xa0\\nancient tomatoes were the size of today’s peas. After agriculture, the next step towards recovery\\xa0\\xa0 would be rebuilding industrial capacity,\\xa0\\nlike power grids and automated manufacturing.\\xa0\\xa0 A huge problem is that our economies of scale make\\xa0\\nit impossible to just pick up where we left off.\\xa0\\xa0 Many of our high tech industries are\\xa0\\nonly functional because of huge demand\\xa0\\xa0 and intensely interconnected supply\\xa0\\nchains across different continents.\\xa0\\xa0 Even if our infrastructure were left unharmed, we\\xa0\\nwould make huge steps backwards technologically. But then again, we are thinking in larger time\\xa0\\nframes. Industrialization originally happened\\xa0\\xa0 12,000 years after the agricultural revolution. So\\xa0\\nif we need to start over after a massive collapse,\\xa0\\xa0 it shouldn’t be that hard to re-industrialize,\\xa0\\nat least on evolutionary timescales. There’s a hitch, though. The Industrial\\xa0\\nRevolution was fuelled, literally, by burning\\xa0\\xa0 easily-accessible coal and we are still very\\xa0\\nmuch reliant on it. If we use it all up today,\\xa0\\xa0 aside from making rapid climate change\\xa0\\nmuch worse, we could hinder our ability\\xa0\\xa0 to recover from a huge crisis. So we\\xa0\\nshould stop using easy-to-access coal,\\xa0\\xa0 so it can serve as a civilization\\xa0\\ninsurance in case something bad happens. Another thing that makes recovery likely is that\\xa0\\nwe’d probably have most of the information we\\xa0\\xa0 need to rebuild civilization. We would certainly\\xa0\\nlose a lot of crucial institutional knowledge,\\xa0\\xa0 especially on hard drives that nobody could\\xa0\\nread or operate anymore. But a lot of the\\xa0\\xa0 technological, scientific, and cultural knowledge\\xa0\\nstored in the world's 2.6 million libraries,\\xa0\\xa0 would survive the catastrophe. The post-collapse\\xa0\\nsurvivors would know what used to be possible,\\xa0\\xa0 and they could reverse engineer some\\xa0\\nof the tools and machines they’d find. In conclusion, despite the bleak\\xa0\\nprospect of catastrophic threats,\\xa0\\xa0 natural or created by ourselves,\\xa0\\nthere is reason for optimism:\\xa0\\xa0 humankind is remarkably resilient, and even in\\xa0\\nthe case of a global civilizational collapse,\\xa0\\xa0 it seems likely that we would be able to recover\\xa0\\n– Even if many people were to perish or suffer\\xa0\\xa0 immense hardship. Even if we lost cultural\\xa0\\nand technological achievements in the process. But given the stakes, the risks are still\\xa0\\nunnervingly high. Nuclear war and dangerous\\xa0\\xa0 pandemics threaten the amazing global civilization\\xa0\\nwe have built. Humanity is like a teenager,\\xa0\\xa0 speeding around blind corners, drunk, without\\xa0\\na seat belt. The good news is that it is still\\xa0\\xa0 early enough to prepare for and to mitigate\\xa0\\nthese risks. We just need to actually do it.\", \"In the 1970s thousands of Chickenheads rained\\xa0\\nfrom the sky in Europe, making foxes and other\\xa0\\xa0 wildlife confused and very happy. Why? They were\\xa0\\nfilled with a vaccine to fight the deadliest\\xa0\\xa0 virus known to humanity – since the 1930s\\xa0\\na rabies epidemic had been sweeping across\\xa0\\xa0 wildlife populations in Europe and humans wanted\\xa0\\nto finally get rid of the virus once and for all. Rabies is named after Lyssa, the\\xa0\\nancient Greek spirit of mad rage,\\xa0\\xa0 and has been haunting us for at least 4000\\xa0\\nyears. It can turn animals into angry beasts\\xa0\\xa0 and humans into zombies that fear water. But\\xa0\\nwhat makes Lyssa fascinating is not just how\\xa0\\xa0 bizarre and deadly its infection is, but also how\\xa0\\nincredibly good it is at avoiding our defenses. Viruses exist on the edge between life and death,\\xa0\\nhardly more than a few genetic instructions that\\xa0\\xa0 need living cells to multiply. The lyssavirus is\\xa0\\nsimple even for a virus: It has only five genes,\\xa0\\xa0 that is the instructions for five proteins that\\xa0\\nlet it solve complex problems: Infect a mammal,\\xa0\\xa0 avoid its immune system, travel to its brain,\\xa0\\nmake more of itself and infect new hosts. Let's see what happens if you get infected. It all starts with a bite, most likely by a\\xa0\\ndog carrying millions of viruses in its saliva,\\xa0\\xa0 pushing them deep into the tissue. The goal is\\xa0\\nyour nerve cells, your neurons. They are living\\xa0\\xa0 electrochemical wires, transferring signals\\xa0\\nthroughout your body, and can stretch for up\\xa0\\xa0 to 1.5 meters, with their cellular machinery\\xa0\\non one end and a terminal on the other. The terminal is where cells talk to each other,\\xa0\\nby passing chemicals that convey information.\\xa0\\xa0 Lyssa probably binds to the receptors\\xa0\\nthat are crucial for this process\\xa0\\xa0 and slips inside the unsuspecting nerve cells. Inside, the virus has to solve a big problem.\\xa0\\nIt needs to get to the cellular machinery to\\xa0\\xa0 take over the cell and make more viruses\\xa0\\n– and because neurons are pretty long,\\xa0\\xa0 this can be far away. There\\xa0\\nis a solution at hand though: Cells have microtubules spanning their\\xa0\\ninsides that give them structural integrity.\\xa0\\xa0 But they also provide a track system\\xa0\\nfor a specialized delivery system:\\xa0\\xa0 Dynein motors are actual motors that use energy\\xa0\\nand deliver packages. They are made from 50\\xa0\\xa0 different proteins, ten times more than the virus,\\xa0\\nand look like a little pair of shoes. Lyssa uses\\xa0\\xa0 one of its five proteins to hijack this amazing\\xa0\\nsystem and order it to head for the nucleus. What is the immune system doing to prevent\\xa0\\nall of that? Well, unfortunately not much. Usually when a virus attacks your civilian cells\\xa0\\nare crucial in activating your immune response.\\xa0\\xa0 They notice that they have been infected and\\xa0\\nrelease hundreds of thousands of a special family\\xa0\\xa0 of proteins: The interferons that, well, interfere\\xa0\\nwith viruses. We’ll have to simplify a lot,\\xa0\\xa0 but in a nutshell, Interferons alert your\\xa0\\nimmune system to make antivirus weapons.\\xa0\\xa0 But they do much more: they tell civilian\\xa0\\ncells to turn down their protein factories\\xa0\\xa0 for a while – which means that viruses\\xa0\\ncan’t replicate efficiently anymore. And interferons tell your cells to become super\\xa0\\ntransparent, which is important, because how\\xa0\\xa0 can your immune cells notice that your civilian\\xa0\\ncells are infected when viruses hide inside them? Your body solves this by creating display windows\\xa0\\ninto their insides, called MHC class I molecules.\\xa0\\xa0 Cells constantly produce stuff to stay alive,\\xa0\\xa0 and to showcase to your immune cells what is\\xa0\\ngoing on inside them, they take random samples\\xa0\\xa0 of their products and put them into these\\xa0\\ntiny display windows to give a peek inside. Interferon tells your cells to make WAY more\\xa0\\ndisplay windows and become super transparent.\\xa0\\xa0 If a cell is infected and forced to make virus\\xa0\\nparts, your immune cells will see these parts\\xa0\\xa0 in a window and order the infected cell to\\xa0\\nkill itself – and all the viruses trapped\\xa0\\xa0 within. This is one of the most powerful\\xa0\\nmethods of wiping out a viral infection. Unfortunately Lyssa blocks your neurons\\xa0\\nfrom making interferons and stays basically\\xa0\\xa0 invisible to your immune system. In contrast\\xa0\\nto many other viruses, when it replicates,\\xa0\\xa0 it doesn’t kill its host, which\\xa0\\nwould also trigger alarm systems.\\xa0\\xa0 Instead it stealthily jumps from neuron to\\xa0\\nneuron, very slowly making its way to your brain. This phase can take weeks to\\xa0\\nmonths and very rarely even years\\xa0\\xa0 and depends on a bunch of things, like if the bite\\xa0\\nwas in your face or foot or how many viruses got\\xa0\\xa0 into your muscles. Lyssa is a patient monster.\\xa0\\nUntil it reaches its goal: Your brainstem. Finally, the immune system catches\\xa0\\non that something isn’t right\\xa0\\xa0 and reacts. It dispatches some of your most\\xa0\\npowerful antivirus cells, Killer T Cells,\\xa0\\xa0 to seek and kill infected cells and wipe out the\\xa0\\nenemy. In other viral infections this would be a\\xa0\\xa0 turning point, but in rabies the T cells are\\xa0\\nrushing towards their doom. Simple Lyssa with\\xa0\\xa0 its 5 proteins plays a uno reverse card, using\\xa0\\nthe immune system’s ingenuity against itself. Your central nervous system is a very fragile\\xa0\\npart of your body and so the immune system has\\xa0\\xa0 to be very careful. A few haywire immune\\xa0\\ncells in your brain is a quick way to die.\\xa0\\xa0 So they aren’t free to enter your nervous\\xa0\\nsystem, they have to be be invited in\\xa0\\xa0 and can be kicked out. To protect themselves, your\\xa0\\nnerve cells can order T Cells to self-destruct,\\xa0\\xa0 if they think they are overreacting. And Lyssa\\xa0\\nfigured out a way to make infected neurons express\\xa0\\xa0 this order. So as your powerful defense cells\\xa0\\narrive – they are ordered to commit suicide. \\n\\xa0 Now the virus infiltrates the brain stem. Once\\xa0\\nthis stage is reached you are going to die. How Lyssa Kills One of the most irritating things about\\xa0\\nthe Lyssavirus is that we still don’t\\xa0\\xa0 know exactly how and why an infected person dies. Our usual idea of viruses causing\\xa0\\ndamage is by multiplying rapidly,\\xa0\\xa0 killing their host cells once they have made\\xa0\\nenough copies, triggering a massive immune\\xa0\\xa0 reaction that also does a lot of damage. But\\xa0\\nthis doesn’t seem to be what happens here.\\xa0\\xa0 Brain tissue of rabies patients shows\\xa0\\nminimal, sometimes non-existent damage.\\xa0 Instead of murdering everything in sight, it\\xa0\\nis currently thought that lyssa wreaks havoc\\xa0\\xa0 by messing up the neuron communication inside your\\xa0\\nbrain, so much so, that it can’t function anymore. It attacks the brain and leads to symptoms\\xa0\\nlike confusion, aggression and paralysis.\\xa0 Now the virus begins to leave. Still traveling\\xa0\\nthrough neurons, it migrates away from the brain\\xa0\\xa0 and heads for the salivary glands. This is\\xa0\\nremarkable, because after traveling in one\\xa0\\xa0 direction the virus reverses its course. After\\xa0\\ndecades of study we don’t know how this works.\\xa0\\xa0 Lyssa ends up saturating your saliva\\xa0\\nready for the irate mammal to bite another\\xa0\\xa0 and repeat the cycle. While this seems\\xa0\\nlike the beginning of a Zombie outbreak,\\xa0\\xa0 luckily there are no known cases of a human\\xa0\\nbiting another and spreading rabies this way. Now the end is near. You are rapidly developing\\xa0\\nencephalitis, a swelling of the brain with many\\xa0\\xa0 unpleasant neurological symptoms, from lethargy\\xa0\\nto paralysis. Slowly at first, and then suddenly,\\xa0\\xa0 organ after organ fails as you slip into a coma.\\xa0\\nThere is no known effective therapy, barely anyone\\xa0\\xa0 has ever survived Lyssa once symptoms begin to\\xa0\\nshow. It is by far the deadliest virus we know. Except, there is actually something\\xa0\\nthat could save you – a vaccine.\\xa0\\xa0 Rabies was one of the first diseases\\xa0\\nhumans developed a vaccine for.\\xa0\\xa0 As vaccines do, it prepares your immune system for\\xa0\\na future attack, so it has the right weapons ready\\xa0\\xa0 in high numbers. The horrific tricks of simple\\xa0\\nLyssa don’t work once you are vaccinated. And the\\xa0\\xa0 vaccine is special for another reason – because\\xa0\\nLyssa is so slow in the first few weeks, it can\\xa0\\xa0 be given to you after you have been exposed. So\\xa0\\nyou can still be vaccinated after you have been\\xa0\\xa0 bitten by an animal. Which is super important\\xa0\\nif you’ve had contact with a sick wild animal,\\xa0\\xa0 say a bat, because you often don’t\\xa0\\neven notice a bite from tiny teeth. Rabies is a monster. One that has followed\\xa0\\nour species around for thousands of years,\\xa0\\xa0 that our ancestors were terrified of and rightly\\xa0\\nso. It still kills around 60,000 people each year,\\xa0\\xa0 almost half of them children. We are far from\\xa0\\neradicating this monster – It lurks in the\\xa0\\xa0 shadows, in forests and animals of all kinds,\\xa0\\nready to return in greater numbers if we ever\\xa0\\xa0 forget how to keep it at bay, or if we continue\\xa0\\nthe trend of being suspicious of vaccines. Let us hope that one day\\xa0\\nhumanity slays this monster,\\xa0\\xa0 so it can become like most\\xa0\\nmonsters: Part of our imagination.\", \"The future of humanity seems insecure.\\xa0\\nRapid climate change, political division,\\xa0\\xa0 our greed and failings make it hard to look at\\xa0\\nour species with a lot of optimism and so many\\xa0\\xa0 people think our end is in sight. But humans have\\xa0\\nalways thought they lived in the end times. Every\\xa0\\xa0 generation assumes they’re important enough to\\xa0\\nwitness the apocalypse and then life just goes on. This is a problem because it\\xa0\\nleads to short term thinking\\xa0\\xa0 and prevents us from creating the best world\\xa0\\nfor ourselves and our descendents. What makes\\xa0\\xa0 this worse is that we may actually BE living at\\xa0\\nan extremely critical moment in human history.\\xa0\\xa0 To understand why, let us look at the\\xa0\\ntemporal window of humanity and ask: When will the last human be born and\\xa0\\nhow many people will there ever be? These sorts of estimates come with a\\xa0\\nlot of uncertainties, so please take\\xa0\\xa0 them with a gigantic grain of salt. To get\\xa0\\na sense of how many people there will be,\\xa0\\xa0 let us see how many have already lived. Modern\\xa0\\nhumans arose some 200 thousand years ago.\\xa0\\xa0 They were uniquely good at\\xa0\\nmaking tools, telling stories,\\xa0\\xa0 thinking abstractly, planning and working together\\xa0\\nin large groups beyond their close family. Still there were not that many of us. Surpluses\\xa0\\nin food were sparse, survival was hard,\\xa0\\xa0 life expectancy was low. It took us 150,000\\xa0\\nyears to grow to a population of 2 million.\\xa0\\xa0 Improvements were gradual and eventually\\xa0\\nled to the agricultural revolution,\\xa0\\xa0 arguably the biggest change in our history.\\xa0\\nThis was when our numbers really started\\xa0\\xa0 growing. It took ten thousand more years to get\\xa0\\nto 300 million. But that increase was dwarfed\\xa0\\xa0 by the industrial revolution. In 1800 there\\xa0\\nwere a billion of us. The human population\\xa0\\xa0 doubled in just 120 years and then again in\\xa0\\nfifty. Today, we number around 8 billion. In total, over the last two hundred thousand years\\xa0\\nabout 117 billion humans were born and lived,\\xa0\\xa0 and 109 billion also died. Which means that\\xa0\\nabout 7% of all humans that ever lived are alive\\xa0\\xa0 right now. As many as were born in the first\\xa0\\n150,000 years of human history. Every minute,\\xa0\\xa0 270 babies join the party. But there are not just\\xa0\\nmore people, never before have we been as healthy\\xa0\\xa0 and well off, or lived longer. With growing\\xa0\\nliving standards our birth rates collapsed.\\xa0\\xa0 The UN estimates that around the year 2100\\xa0\\nwe will hit our population peak and there\\xa0\\xa0 will be 125 million people born each year.\\xa0\\nIt is pretty unlikely that birth rates will\\xa0\\xa0 stay stable forever, but let’s pretend\\xa0\\nto make our thought experiment simpler. How many people there will be in the future\\xa0\\ndepends on when our species will die out.\\xa0\\xa0 And here we find a lot of uncertainties.\\xa0\\nWe are able to destroy ourselves through\\xa0\\xa0 our own inventions – but we are also able to\\xa0\\nfind solutions to avert catastrophic risk. We can change the direction of planet killer\\xa0\\nasteroids but we’ve also invented nuclear weapons.\\xa0\\xa0 We discovered antibiotics but also carry diseases\\xa0\\nacross the globe in a matter of days. Our\\xa0\\xa0 industrial system gave us an incredible standard\\xa0\\nof living but also changed the atmosphere in the\\xa0\\xa0 process. It is very hard to say if human ingenuity\\xa0\\nwill prolong or shorten our species’ lifespan. If things go badly our end could come\\xa0\\nsuddenly. But if we manage to avoid that,\\xa0\\xa0 we could conceivably stick around for a long\\xa0\\ntime. So every day we don’t destroy ourselves\\xa0\\xa0 may mean life for an unfathomable number of\\xa0\\nhumans. How many people are we talking about?\\xa0\\xa0 It depends on how far our\\xa0\\nspecies is going to expand. Scenario 1: Humans will never leave Earth If we stay on our home planet, a good metric\\xa0\\nto look at is the extinction rate of animals\\xa0\\xa0 that we get from the fossil record. The\\xa0\\naverage lifespan of mammalian species is\\xa0\\xa0 in the region of 1 million years, with\\xa0\\nsome surviving up to 10 million years.\\xa0\\xa0 Our close relative homo erectus\\xa0\\nsurvived for about 1.9 million years. Let us be conservative and assume that humans\\xa0\\nwill survive for a million years, which leaves\\xa0\\xa0 us 800,000 more years to dawdle away. Assuming a\\xa0\\nstable birth rate of 125 million people each year,\\xa0\\xa0 this means there are roughly 100\\xa0\\nTRILLION humans waiting to be born.\\xa0\\xa0 850 times greater than the number\\xa0\\nof people that have ever lived.\\xa0\\xa0 This would make everybody alive today only\\xa0\\n0.008% of all people that will ever live. Think about where this leaves you. Instead\\xa0\\nof putting you at the end of the chaotic\\xa0\\xa0 mess that was our past, it would mean you\\xa0\\nlive at the very beginning of something big.\\xa0\\xa0 The start of the human story rather than the\\xa0\\nend. Doesn’t this feel incredibly different? And now consider that this may be\\xa0\\nan extremely pessimistic estimate.\\xa0\\xa0 If we match the survival time of the most\\xa0\\nsuccessful mammals, then our future numbers\\xa0\\xa0 rise to 1.2 quadrillion people that have yet to be\\xa0\\nborn. And even this seems far from our potential:\\xa0\\xa0 As the sun slowly gets hotter and brighter, earth\\xa0\\nwill remain habitable for about 500 million years,\\xa0\\xa0 giving so many more potential people\\xa0\\nthe chance to become actual people. And now let’s begin to think big. Scenario 2: Humans will leave Earth We went from humans worshipping\\xa0\\nthe moon, to humans walking on it,\\xa0\\xa0 so who knows how much farther we can go? If we\\xa0\\ndon't die out within the next few hundred years,\\xa0\\xa0 ideas that seem outlandish right\\xa0\\nnow become serious considerations. If we believe that we have a chance of\\xa0\\nsurviving for maybe millions of years,\\xa0\\xa0 then we could expand onto the other planets\\xa0\\nor into our own artificial worlds. Life needs\\xa0\\xa0 three things: a surface, resources and energy.\\xa0\\xa0 Our Sun provides energy for billions of years and\\xa0\\nthere is so much water and material floating in\\xa0\\xa0 the asteroid and kuiper belt that we could\\xa0\\nsustain many times our current population. Instead of living on planets, we could decide to\\xa0\\nconstruct our own artificial worlds and habitats.\\xa0\\xa0 With resources and energy so abundant, we could\\xa0\\ntry out different types of society and ways of\\xa0\\xa0 life. An interconnected civilization spanning the\\xa0\\nsolar system would create the basis of existence\\xa0\\xa0 for an absurd number of individuals, orders of\\xa0\\nmagnitude more than if we stick to earth, even\\xa0\\xa0 if it only existed for a few million years. This\\xa0\\nfuture doesn’t have to be grim and dark as science\\xa0\\xa0 fiction likes to paint it. With quadrillions of\\xa0\\npeople waiting to be born, we will have billions\\xa0\\xa0 of doctors working on curing cancer, billions\\xa0\\nof problem solvers working on ending poverty and\\xa0\\xa0 billions of video game developers making life\\xa0\\nfun. More humans may actually mean more progress. Another upside of leaving earth and spreading\\xa0\\nout is that it becomes much harder for us to\\xa0\\xa0 become extinct, as you need a solar system\\xa0\\nwide catastrophe to catch everybody.\\xa0\\xa0 So aside from nearby supernovae\\xa0\\nor Gamma Rays bursts,\\xa0\\xa0 humanity would be relatively safe from\\xa0\\nextinction, maybe for billions of years. If we manage to survive for that long, slow\\xa0\\nevolution or genetic engineering might split us\\xa0\\xa0 into multiple species, or we might intentionally\\xa0\\nkeep ourselves the same as we are now.\\xa0\\xa0 So to account for that, we’ll just talk\\xa0\\nabout people from now on, instead of humans. Ok. Now let us think really big. Szenario 3: People leave the Solar System As enormous as the solar system is, it is just\\xa0\\none star system among billions in the milky way.\\xa0\\xa0 If future people can colonize, say, 100 billion\\xa0\\nstars and live there for 10 billion years, while\\xa0\\xa0 each generating 100 million births per year, then\\xa0\\nwe can expect something like a hundred Octillion\\xa0\\xa0 lives to be lived in the future. This is a 1 with\\xa0\\n29 zeros, a hundred thousand trillion, trillion. We can spin this up as much as we like. The\\xa0\\nAndromeda Galaxy will merge with the Milky way,\\xa0\\xa0 adding another trillion stars for us to settle.\\xa0\\nRed Dwarfs stay active for up to a trillion\\xa0\\xa0 years and future civilizations might even find\\xa0\\nenergy for their habitats around black holes.\\xa0\\xa0 A sufficiently advanced civilization of our\\xa0\\ndescendants might even try to reach other\\xa0\\xa0 galaxy groups. While these numbers are mind\\xa0\\nblowing, they may underestimate the number of\\xa0\\xa0 unborn people by many orders of magnitude. If we\\xa0\\ndivide the total energy available in a galaxy by\\xa0\\xa0 the average energy needs of a single person,\\xa0\\nthen we get a tredecillion potential lives.\\xa0\\xa0 A million, trillion, trillion,\\xa0\\ntrillion potential people. Conclusion Hopefully what has become evident is that\\xa0\\nif we don’t kill ourselves in the next\\xa0\\xa0 few centuries or millennia, almost all humans\\xa0\\nthat will ever exist, will live in the future.\\xa0\\xa0 Which brings us back to us, in the present.\\xa0\\nWe exist at a highpoint of human history,\\xa0\\xa0 with incredible possibilities at our grasp.\\xa0\\nTechnological, environmental and societal.\\xa0\\xa0 What we do matters for all the\\xa0\\npeople who do not exist yet. So while it is not en vogue to think\\xa0\\nabout humanity's long term future with\\xa0\\xa0 optimism – or to think about it at all –,\\xa0\\nmaybe this has given you a bit of perspective.\\xa0\\xa0 If we screw up the present, so many\\xa0\\npeople may never come to exist.\\xa0\\xa0 Quadrillions of unborn humans are at our mercy.\\nEven if we go with fairly conservative estimates,\\xa0\\xa0 the unborn are by far the largest group of people\\xa0\\n– and the most disenfranchised. Somebody who might\\xa0\\xa0 be born in a thousand or even a million years\\xa0\\ndeeply depends on us today for their existence. This is why it is important to think about the\\xa0\\ndistant future and why our presence is so crucial,\\xa0\\xa0 why it matters what we do today. One day the\\xa0\\nlast human will be born. We don’t know when.\\xa0\\xa0 But if we change our perspective from\\xa0\\nus living at the end of the human story,\\xa0\\xa0 to us living at the very beginning we can\\xa0\\nnot only build a wonderful world for us\\xa0\\xa0 and for them but also for\\xa0\\ncountless numbers of others.

So please help us spread the word\\xa0\\n– and thank you for watching.\", \"If you are like most people, there is a gap\\xa0\\nbetween the person you are and the person you\\xa0\\xa0 wish to be. There are little things you think you\\xa0\\nshould do and big things you ought to achieve. From working out regularly, eating healthily,\\xa0\\nlearning a language, working on your novel,\\xa0\\xa0 reading more or simply actually doing\\xa0\\nyour hobby instead of browsing reddit. But it sometimes seems that to achieve\\xa0\\nyour goals, you have to become a different\\xa0\\xa0 person. Someone who is consistent, puts in\\xa0\\nmore effort, has discipline and willpower.\\xa0\\xa0 Maybe you have tried your hardest to be like\\xa0\\nthat. And it worked! For a while. Until you\\xa0\\xa0 find yourself slipping back into your old\\xa0\\nways. In the end, you always seem to fail.\\xa0\\xa0 And with every failed attempt, you become more\\xa0\\nand more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. If you believe “success and hustle”\\xa0\\ninternet, it is all your own fault:\\xa0\\xa0 if you don't succeed, you just didn’t want it\\xa0\\nenough and the failure is all you. But change\\xa0\\xa0 is actually hard. And as with most things in\\xa0\\nlife, understanding why makes things easier. The Jungle Imagine your brain as a lush and\\xa0\\ndense jungle. Moving through it,\\xa0\\xa0 say to make a decision to do something,\\xa0\\nis like moving through an *actual* jungle:\\xa0\\xa0 It is hard and it costs energy.\\xa0\\nYour brain hates expending energy,\\xa0\\xa0 so it came up with a trick: All your actions and\\xa0\\nbehaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain. As you start doing something, you trample down\\xa0\\nsome plants and make rough, improvised trails\\xa0\\xa0 through the undergrowth. The more often you do\\xa0\\nthe thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes.\\xa0\\xa0 Over time it turns into a path that is\\xa0\\neasier to tread, so you take it more often\\xa0\\xa0 and it turns into a street. As you repeat\\xa0\\ndoing the thing, over and over for years,\\xa0\\xa0 the street turns into a highway. Traversing it\\xa0\\nbecomes effortless, familiar and comfortable. The more pronounced your brain highways,\\xa0\\nthe more you get used to their comfort.\\xa0\\xa0 So we continue to use them, which means\\xa0\\nwe tend to do what we have always done.\\xa0\\xa0 This is why change is hard, especially as an adult\\xa0\\xa0 when your jungle is criss-crossed by\\xa0\\nlots of established streets and highways. To understand how those highways are built\\xa0\\nwe need to distinguish between two things:\\xa0\\xa0 Routines and habits. The Things You Do: Routines and Habits A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry\\xa0\\nout the same way every time because they’ve worked\\xa0\\xa0 out well for you. For example, you get the\\xa0\\nsame ingredients for your favorite dish and\\xa0\\xa0 cook them in a certain order, because you like\\xa0\\nthe taste of the result. Or before going to bed\\xa0\\xa0 you set an alarm at 6:30 because\\xa0\\nthis is when you want to get up. Imagine routines executed by a wise planner. It is\\xa0\\nslow and analytical, responsible for strategizing\\xa0\\xa0 and mental calculations. The planner is\\xa0\\naware of the future and carefully considers\\xa0\\xa0 what kind of result you want. Based on that, it\\xa0\\nchooses actions to achieve specific outcomes,\\xa0\\xa0 even if they are uncomfortable, like\\xa0\\ntaking a shower after getting up. Routines can eventually turn into\\xa0\\nhabits, which feel much easier\\xa0\\xa0 because they are basically a sequence of\\xa0\\nactions carried out without thinking about them.\\xa0\\xa0 You have done them so often before that\\xa0\\nyour brain considers them rewarding\\xa0\\xa0 and a great response to a situation. So a\\xa0\\nhabit can feel like you’re on autopilot.\\xa0\\xa0 You don’t have to convince yourself to do\\xa0\\nsomething that’s a habit - you just do it. The important thing about habits is\\xa0\\nthat they are set in motion by triggers,\\xa0\\xa0 context cues that can be single\\xa0\\nthings or entire situations,\\xa0\\xa0 that give your brain the signal\\xa0\\nto start the behavior or action. You already have a lot of triggers in\\xa0\\nyour life: like when you see your phone,\\xa0\\xa0 you almost always unlock the screen. Or you reach\\xa0\\nfor the seat belt when you sit in a car. Or when\\xa0\\xa0 you buy your coffee before work, you also get a\\xa0\\ncookie, even though you aren’t actually hungry. Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler.\\xa0\\nIt responds to your immediate desires, based\\xa0\\xa0 on what is around you. Without considering\\xa0\\nany longer-term goals. For the toddler,\\xa0\\xa0 the future doesn’t exist and it hates hard work.\\xa0\\nSo when it notices a trigger, it steers you to\\xa0\\xa0 take this easy road inside your brain that leads\\xa0\\nto a familiar rewarding result. If you get coffee,\\xa0\\xa0 the toddler also wants the cookie, just\\xa0\\nbecause that’s what you do every morning. \\u200bThis rewarding feeling is also how most of\\xa0\\nyour bad habits started: chocolate is tasty,\\xa0\\xa0 browsing reddit is occasionally\\xa0\\nmildly entertaining.\\xa0\\xa0 This is why you repeat these actions,\\xa0\\neven if they are bad for you.\\xa0\\xa0 Rewarding feelings associated with an action\\xa0\\ndemand to be repeated and so a bad habit is born. While the toddler sounds like\\xa0\\na built-in sabotage mechanism,\\xa0\\xa0 it is as important as the wise planner and\\xa0\\nactually they work together most of the time! You need your wise planner for thinking big\\xa0\\nthoughts and parallel parking and doing your\\xa0\\xa0 taxes. But letting your wise planner do everything\\xa0\\nwould cost too much energy. Outsourcing mundane\\xa0\\xa0 and repetitive tasks to habits, managed by\\xa0\\nthe toddler, allows your brain to easily\\xa0\\xa0 manage your daily life, while dealing with more\\xa0\\ncomplex mental challenges at the same time. So if we want to change and introduce\\xa0\\na new behavior into our lives,\\xa0\\xa0 we can actually use these energy\\xa0\\nsaving mechanisms to make it easier. We will focus on small things, not big ones.\\xa0\\xa0 Improving your life a little is\\xa0\\nso much better than aiming high\\xa0\\xa0 and changing nothing. Especially because small\\xa0\\nchanges can do a lot over months and years. How To Build a Habit If you want to make change easier,\\xa0\\nthe best way may not be to force\\xa0\\xa0 it with willpower but to convince your\\xa0\\nbrain that it’s not that big of a deal.\\xa0\\xa0 By creating new routines and then turning\\xa0\\nthem into habits. You want your wise planner\\xa0\\xa0 to construct that first trail and then use your\\xa0\\ntoddler to help initiate the action effortlessly. Let us say, you want to work out\\xa0\\nto be fitter, a very common goal.\\xa0\\xa0 The first thing to do is to break down this\\xa0\\npretty vague goal into clear, separate actions,\\xa0\\xa0 because the idea is to make the action\\xa0\\nitself as easy a threshold as possible:\\xa0\\xa0 so small it is manageable and so specific\\xa0\\nthat you don’t have to think about it a lot. For example, a tangible,\\xa0\\ncontrollable action might be\\xa0\\xa0 “doing ten squats” every morning. So you\\xa0\\ncan start by trying to create a routine\\xa0\\xa0 but already include clear triggers\\xa0\\nthat the toddler can pick up later on. Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a\\xa0\\nsignal that you always associate with the action.\\xa0\\xa0 They can be visual pointers like seeing\\xa0\\na particular object, like your training\\xa0\\xa0 outfit. Or a certain time of day, or a designated\\xa0\\nplace like a nearby park – or even better, all of\\xa0\\xa0 these things combined. The important thing is that\\xa0\\nyou always start doing your action in a specific\\xa0\\xa0 context. This trigger is the start button that\\xa0\\nwill eventually set off the action automatically. So to establish a home workout habit with ten\\xa0\\nsquats to begin with, you could make sure to\\xa0\\xa0 always do them with your exercise gear on, at the\\xa0\\nsame place and time, like in your living room at\\xa0\\xa0 8am. Once you have your trigger and action,\\xa0\\nall you need to do is repeat them regularly,\\xa0\\xa0 ideally every day. If you keep going, they\\xa0\\nwill change from a routine to a habit,\\xa0\\xa0 from a trail to a highway. Don’t get this wrong,\\xa0\\nthe squats will still take you energy to do – but\\xa0\\xa0 the decision to do them will feel much less like\\xa0\\na chore and more like a regular part of your day. While this is simple, it is not easy. Many things you want to turn into habits don’t\\xa0\\noffer as much instant gratification as wasting\\xa0\\xa0 time on reddit. To make your new action easier\\xa0\\nto repeat and more likely to be picked up by\\xa0\\xa0 the toddler, try to make it pleasurable.\\xa0\\nNot necessarily by rewarding yourself\\xa0\\xa0 after you did it, but by making the action\\xa0\\nor behavior itself more enjoyable. Like only\\xa0\\xa0 listening to your favorite podcast while\\xa0\\nworking out, or chipping away at your taxes\\xa0\\xa0 while you wait for civilization to load the next\\xa0\\nround. You need to figure out what works for you. In principle, that's it. Frustratingly simple, like most things you can\\xa0\\ndo to make your life better. How long it takes\\xa0\\xa0 for your toddler to take over and establish a\\xa0\\nhabit varies widely. It depends on the behavior\\xa0\\xa0 you are trying to get used to, what kind of person\\xa0\\nyou are, your stress levels and many more things.\\xa0\\xa0 It takes anything between 15 and 250\\xa0\\ndays until a new habit is kicked off\\xa0\\xa0 automatically by its trigger. You won't\\xa0\\nknow how long it will take for you. Starting is the easy part,\\xa0\\nespecially in the first week or two.\\xa0\\xa0 Continuing to do it every day is the hard\\xa0\\npart. But it does get easier as you keep going. There are no silver bullets for\\xa0\\nchange. But the science of habits\\xa0\\xa0 is a reminder that it is possible,\\xa0\\nno matter how old or young you are.\\xa0\\xa0 Even if you only end up doing a little more good\\xa0\\nstuff or a few new things, that’s still a success.\\xa0\\xa0 Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgable\\xa0\\nis a million times better than being unhappy about\\xa0\\xa0 a thing and changing nothing. In the end,\\xa0\\nchange is a direction, not a destination. So now that we hopefully gave you a bit\\xa0\\nof insight and motivation, this is the\\xa0\\xa0 moment to sell you a thing! But please know, you\\xa0\\ndo not need to buy anything to work on yourself. Having said that, we struggle with\\xa0\\nchange as much as anyone else,\\xa0\\xa0 so we created our own habit journal, as much for\\xa0\\nourselves as for you. Before we printed anything,\\xa0\\xa0 we tested it on ourselves and got\\xa0\\nfeedback from the Kurzgesagt team. The idea is for you to track your habit\\xa0\\nprogress for your desired behavior.\\xa0\\xa0 There is a tutorial part which guides you through\\xa0\\nthe hardest part of the process step by step.\\xa0\\xa0 You’ll get helpful pointers, reflect on your\\xa0\\nprogress and how you could make things easier for\\xa0\\xa0 yourself. Once you get through the tutorial part\\xa0\\nthe habit journaling starts, regularly interwoven\\xa0\\xa0 by examples, science Breaks and reflections that\\xa0\\nwill hopefully keep the journey interesting. Like our Gratitude Journal it is cloth-bound,\\xa0\\nwith an embossed hardcover and printed on\\xa0\\xa0 high-quality paper. Nice to the touch and\\xa0\\nwith lots of beautiful illustrations this\\xa0\\xa0 book is compangion on your personal change\\xa0\\njourney, however small or big it may be. Getting things from our shop is\\xa0\\nthe best way to support Kurzgesagt\\xa0\\xa0 and what we try to do here on the\\xa0\\nchannel. Thank you for watching.\", \"Look around you. Where are you? Where is this\\xa0\\nplace you are occupying? Somewhere in a room,\\xa0\\xa0 maybe in a city on a continent on a planet\\xa0\\norbiting a star in a galaxy among billions.\\xa0\\xa0 But… where is all of that? While\\xa0\\nthis may feel like a daft question,\\xa0\\xa0 it turns out that the concept of an absolute\\xa0\\nposition is something humans made up. In a nutshell, the universe is a big\\xa0\\nbag of space that has things in it.\\xa0\\xa0 If someone removed all these things, the\\xa0\\nstars and planets and black holes and dust,\\xa0\\xa0 there would just be empty space left.\\xa0\\nIn empty space, the concept of having\\xa0\\xa0 a position loses all meaning. Empty\\xa0\\nspace is uniform, the same everywhere. The space we occupy is not like a stage under\\xa0\\nour feet. We can't mark specific points,\\xa0\\xa0 or staple something to spacetime as an\\xa0\\nanchor. Without things there is no position.\\xa0\\xa0 We are really ever only at a position\\xa0\\nin relation to something else.\\xa0\\xa0 Which also means that things we take for granted,\\xa0\\nlike up and down are actually relative too. Ok, let us fill the universe up with things again\\xa0\\xa0 and try to find out where you are,\\xa0\\nright now. Relative to everything else. Let us start this video at a familiar place\\xa0\\nand then get increasingly weird. From your\\xa0\\xa0 perspective the world is seemingly flat and you\\xa0\\ncan move in 3 dimensions. It's what physicists\\xa0\\xa0 call a 'frame of reference' - the perspective\\xa0\\nyou have of the universe and how you see things\\xa0\\xa0 moving around you. Where your up and down\\xa0\\nis. Your frame of reference is correct.\\xa0\\xa0 For you – but not for the rest of the universe. Around 5 kilometers from you, where the horizon\\xa0\\nbegins, the ground noticeably curves away from\\xa0\\xa0 you. If you could see through the ground,\\xa0\\nyou’d see people from below or sideways.\\xa0\\xa0 But they don't fall 'down' off the planet\\xa0\\nbecause gravity doesn't actually pull them down.\\xa0\\xa0 'Down' is an illusion of your reference frame. To\\xa0\\nearth's reference frame, gravity just pulls in. But for humans there is an up and down because\\xa0\\nwithin our frame of reference that just makes\\xa0\\xa0 sense. Which is also why we think that the planet\\xa0\\nitself has an up and down, north and south. And\\xa0\\xa0 we made our maps accordingly. But an observer\\xa0\\nlooking at the solar system might disagree.\\xa0\\xa0 Our maps make sense to us because we are\\xa0\\nused to them, not because they are correct. Ok. So this is step one – your position\\xa0\\non what feels like a flat surface but\\xa0\\xa0 is actually a sphere. But this sphere is\\xa0\\nalways moving, never staying in one position.\\xa0\\xa0 Earth is orbiting a star, the sun\\xa0\\nat the center of the solar system. While we usually imagine this as pretty orderly,\\xa0\\xa0 someone looking at us from the outside\\xa0\\nwould see something pretty messy.\\xa0\\xa0 To see this more clearly we’ll exaggerate\\xa0\\nall these movements, this is not to scale. First of all, our orbit really is an ellipse,\\xa0\\nso we spend half the year sinking a little\\xa0\\xa0 bit closer to the sun speeding up, and half\\xa0\\nthe year rising up a bit and slowing down.\\xa0\\xa0 And the ellipsis itself changes\\xa0\\nits shape every 100,000 years too. And in another cycle of 112,000 years, the\\xa0\\nellipse itself is drifting – which at least\\xa0\\xa0 creates a beautiful shape. In the end, we\\xa0\\nget an orbital path that looks like a wobbly\\xa0\\xa0 circle with wavy edges. And it gets worse, as\\xa0\\nthe moon now starts to screw things up too. As the moon is a pretty massive thing, it pulls on\\xa0\\nearth. Both objects orbit their common center of\\xa0\\xa0 gravity, that lies around 4700 km off to the\\xa0\\nside of Earth’s core. In practice this means\\xa0\\xa0 that as the moon orbits earth, it is jerking\\xa0\\nearth around a bit, enough to make it jiggle. Ok so you are standing on the\\xa0\\nsurface of a rotating planet,\\xa0\\xa0 that is jiggling around the sun in an\\xa0\\nelliptical orbit that changes a bit every year. But who's to say the earth is right? From\\xa0\\xa0 the perspective of the sun the plane\\xa0\\nof the solar system is arbitrary,\\xa0\\xa0 it's defined as the plane the earth orbits in\\xa0\\nbecause that is convenient for us. In reality\\xa0\\xa0 the other planets are just a little\\xa0\\nbit inclined with respect to our plane.\\xa0\\xa0 From their point of view, we're the\\xa0\\nones with a slightly bent orbit. But this is not it – far from it! The solar system\\xa0\\nas a whole is orbiting the center of the milky\\xa0\\xa0 way galaxy. If we look at the milky way, we can\\xa0\\nclearly make out a galactic plane in which the\\xa0\\xa0 solar system orbits the center every 230 million\\xa0\\nyears. But of course it is not that simple. First of all, the plane of the solar system\\xa0\\nis not aligned with the plane of the galaxy.\\xa0\\xa0 Nothing really is – just like the planets in the\\xa0\\nsolar system orbit the sun on their own planes, so\\xa0\\xa0 do all the stars orbiting the galactic center. The\\xa0\\nsolar system as a whole is tilted about 60 degrees\\xa0\\xa0 towards the galactic plane, speeding through\\xa0\\nspace at almost a million kilometers per hour. Someone in the center of the galaxy would see\\xa0\\nthe orbits of the planets moving through space\\xa0\\xa0 in a helix shape, which you can\\xa0\\nimagine as a corkscrew motion,\\xa0\\xa0 on the tilted plane of the solar system,\\xa0\\nrelative to the plane of the galaxy. This orientation in space means that sometimes the\\xa0\\xa0 planets are sort of in front of the sun\\xa0\\nas it orbits around the galactic core.\\xa0\\xa0 Let us just look at this for a moment\\xa0\\n– there is a strange and eerie beauty\\xa0\\xa0 abouthow our planets and the sun move through\\xa0\\nspace. Do you feel a bit dizzy? It gets worse. This is still not the whole story because the\\xa0\\nmass of the galactic disk is constantly pulling on\\xa0\\xa0 the solar system too. Like a drunk dolphin, we're\\xa0\\ndiving down and shooting up hundreds of lightyears\\xa0\\xa0 through the galactic plane, ten times every\\xa0\\norbit, along arcs thousands of light years long.\\xa0\\xa0 We haven’t mapped this motion out\\xa0\\ncompletely, as it takes the solar\\xa0\\xa0 system tens of millions of years to go up and\\xa0\\nback once; and, well, humanity is not that old. Let’s look at your relative\\xa0\\nposition again. On a planet,\\xa0\\xa0 tilted towards the sun, jiggled around by\\xa0\\nthe moon. In a solar system tilted towards\\xa0\\xa0 the galactic plane, moving forward in a helical\\xa0\\nshape, diving up and down through the plane. Hm. But where is “up” in a galaxy? At this point\\xa0\\nthe frame of reference becomes a bit arbitrary\\xa0\\xa0 and pointless because of the nature of the\\xa0\\nuniverse at this scale. The Milky way is\\xa0\\xa0 part of a galaxy group that appears to be part of\\xa0\\ngreater structures like the Laniakea Supercluster,\\xa0\\xa0 which itself is part of the gigantic Pisces–Cetus\\xa0\\nSupercluster Complex and finally a galactic\\xa0\\xa0 filament that spans hundreds of millions of\\xa0\\nlightyears in all directions and orientations. Someone looking right at us from that far\\xa0\\naway will only see the End of Greatness.\\xa0\\xa0 All stuff appears homogeneous, the same\\xa0\\neverywhere. Just like with empty space,\\xa0\\xa0 when everything looks the same, who's to say\\xa0\\nanyone's view is better than anyone else's? We have reached the end of our\\xa0\\nlittle exercise in cosmic humility.\\xa0\\xa0 Let us make the journey backwards again. From\\xa0\\nthe indescribably large, to the really large,\\xa0\\xa0 to our galactic home, to our galaxy, to the solar\\xa0\\nsystem diving up and down through the milky way,\\xa0\\xa0 to the jiggle of existence. And finally,\\xa0\\nback to you, right now, watching this video. If this is all a bit much, don’t feel bad.\\xa0\\nThe scale of the universe is brain crushing\\xa0\\xa0 and trying to keep track of how everything is\\xa0\\noriented or decide where the best up and down is,\\xa0\\xa0 is hard. But it doesn't really matter.\\xa0\\nBecause it doesn't change where you are.\\xa0\\xa0 You're already in the best spot you could possibly\\xa0\\nbe – right here, right now. For all you care\\xa0\\xa0 nothing can stop you from being right at\\xa0\\nthe center of your own little universe.\", \"A war has been going on for billions of years\\xa0\\nthat breeds well armed monsters, who struggle with\\xa0\\xa0 other monsters for survival. Having no particular\\xa0\\ninterest in us, most of them are relatively\\xa0\\xa0 harmless, as our immune systems deal with\\xa0\\ntheir weapons easily. But there are exceptions. Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba\\xa0\\nthat has not only developed a\\xa0\\xa0 deadly taste for human brains but is also a\\xa0\\nmatch for our defences and stars in dramatic\\xa0\\xa0 headlines. What happens when\\xa0\\nthis monster enters your body? Naegleria fowleri is an amoeba, a microbe with a\\xa0\\nnucleus, one of the smallest lifeforms on earth.\\xa0\\xa0 It is a voracious hunter of bacteria and other\\xa0\\ncritters that it devours whole and rips into\\xa0\\xa0 pieces. Like many amoebea it is able to transform\\xa0\\ninto different stages that help it survive,\\xa0\\xa0 but most of the time Naegleria\\xa0\\nfowleri is in its trophozoite stage,\\xa0\\xa0 during which it looks like a squishy blob\\xa0\\nwith tiny arms and hunts, divides and thrives. Its natural home is in fresh water: ponds,\\xa0\\nrivers, lakes and hot springs. But unfortunately\\xa0\\xa0 it also feels happy in pipes, swimming pools,\\xa0\\nfountains or spas when they are not properly\\xa0\\xa0 treated. The warmer the water, the more it thrives\\xa0\\nand multiplies. So in the summer, when humans seek\\xa0\\xa0 to cool off and enjoy themselves, the chances\\xa0\\nare highest that both species will interact. Because this makes it hard to avoid, millions of\\xa0\\npeople regularly have contact with the amoeba,\\xa0\\xa0 especially in warmer climates, and many people\\xa0\\neven seem to have antibodies against it.\\xa0\\xa0 And this is mostly ok, you can even\\xa0\\nswallow it without consequences. Things turn bad when people dive or swim in water\\xa0\\ncontaminated with the amoeba and water splashes\\xa0\\xa0 high up into their noses. In a single drop\\xa0\\nof lake water there are millions of viruses,\\xa0\\xa0 bacteria and amoebea and that isn’t really a big\\xa0\\ndeal. But Naegleria fowleri is different. Let\\xa0\\xa0 us zoom into the nose of an unsuspecting victim\\xa0\\nenjoying a great summer day and see what happens. First of all, the amoeba doesn’t\\xa0\\nreally want to be inside your nose\\xa0\\xa0 as it is not really looking for trouble,\\xa0\\nit just wants to eat a few bacteria.\\xa0\\xa0 Instead it is greeted by your natural defenses.\\xa0\\nUnfortunately for humans, Naegleria fowleri\\xa0\\xa0 happens to be exceptionally good at generally\\xa0\\nflying under the radar of your immune system.\\xa0\\xa0 For example, the inside of your nose is covered\\xa0\\nby mucosa, a slime filled with chemicals that\\xa0\\xa0 kill or stun possible invaders or alert immune\\xa0\\ncells. But Naegleria fowleri is not particularly\\xa0\\xa0 bothered by them and instead calmly checks out the\\xa0\\nscenery, mildly annoyed about the whole ordeal. Now, if you are unlucky, the tiny\\xa0\\ncritter stumbles over something\\xa0\\xa0 that actually sparks its interest: Nerve cells. Your nose is filled with a large\\xa0\\nnetwork of olfactory nerve cells\\xa0\\xa0 that pick up molecules from the outside and\\xa0\\ntransmit their information to your olfactory bulb,\\xa0\\xa0 the center of smell in your brain. To do\\xa0\\ntheir job these cells talk to each other by\\xa0\\xa0 releasing various messenger chemicals and\\xa0\\nrecognizing them via specific receptors.\\xa0\\xa0 One of the most important of\\xa0\\nthese chemicals is acetylcholine. Through sheer evolutionary bad\\xa0\\nluck, Naegleria fowleri happens to\\xa0\\xa0 have receptors that recognize acetylcholine.\\xa0\\xa0 And it seems to attract them irresistibly, a\\xa0\\nlittle like moths that are attracted by light. So as your olfactory nerve cells do their job,\\xa0\\nusing plenty of acetylcholine to talk to the\\xa0\\xa0 brain, Naegleria fowleri enters your tissue. It\\xa0\\nseems to follow the chemical signals upstream.\\xa0\\xa0 Neutrophils, crazy suicide warriors begin to\\xa0\\nattack the amoebae. Individually they have no\\xa0\\xa0 chance against them as the invaders are large and\\xa0\\npretty buff fighters, used to dealing with tough\\xa0\\xa0 enemies. So the defenders swarm the intruders\\xa0\\nand kill them either by vomiting chemicals\\xa0\\xa0 that punch holes into them or by literally\\xa0\\nripping parts of them off and devouring them.\\xa0\\xa0 But the Naegleria fowleri train is still on track\\xa0\\nand while the Neutrophil attacks slow them down,\\xa0\\xa0 they continue to follow the olfactory\\xa0\\nnerves to their final destination: Your brain. This process can take between one and nine days\\xa0\\xa0 and you’ll probably not notice\\xa0\\nanything during that time.\\xa0\\xa0 Until the amoebae reach the olfactory bulb, the\\xa0\\ncenter of smell and entrance to your brain. Your\\xa0\\xa0 brain cells are nothing more than helpless victims\\xa0\\nand they all release that wonderful acetylcholine. Naegleria fowleri initiates a massacre and\\xa0\\nreleases an onslaught of various attack molecules.\\xa0\\xa0 Some of them are basically little bombs\\xa0\\nthat rip holes into your cells on contact\\xa0\\xa0 so their pieces can be eagerly\\xa0\\nconsumed. But Naegleria fowleri\\xa0\\xa0 is now multiplying - and it's also becoming\\xa0\\nreally creepy. In a feeding frenzy it can\\xa0\\xa0 develop up to a dozen suckers called food cups,\\xa0\\nthat look like giant eerie mouths. The amoebae\\xa0\\xa0 engage your brain cells, suck them in and\\xa0\\nrip large “bites” out of them while they\\xa0\\xa0 are still alive. Now things escalate quickly\\xa0\\nand the disease that will kill you sets in. Alerted by the massacre, millions\\xa0\\nof immune cells, Neutrophils,\\xa0\\xa0 Eosinophils and microglias invade the\\xa0\\ninfected tissue. Which is a problem:\\xa0\\xa0 your immune system is dangerous and not\\xa0\\nexactly a careful fighter. It's like\\xa0\\xa0 burning down a forest to kill the wolves\\xa0\\ninside it. A really bad idea in the brain. They waste no time and attack the amoeba,\\xa0\\nusing all the weapons available to them,\\xa0\\xa0 from chemicals to trying to eat them\\xa0\\nalive. Neutrophils explode themselves\\xa0\\xa0 to erect barriers spiked with deadly\\xa0\\nchemicals. A fierce battle ensues.\\xa0\\xa0 Naegleria fowleri can actually fight back,\\xa0\\nitself attacking and killing many immune cells. The immune system now throws everything it has at\\xa0\\nthe invader but in vain. The complement system,\\xa0\\xa0 tiny protein bombs that can kill intruders on\\xa0\\ntheir own, are easily disabled. Antibodies,\\xa0\\xa0 usually one of your superweapons, are just\\xa0\\ndestroyed or swallowed. A high fever that\\xa0\\xa0 usually slows enemies down does nothing,\\xa0\\nas the amoeba actually thrives in the heat.\\xa0\\xa0 All the while the amoebae continue to\\xa0\\nmultiply, fight and devour your brain cells. A disastrous chain reaction is taking place.\\xa0\\xa0 One major thing your immune cells do when\\xa0\\nthey fight is to cause inflammation. Which\\xa0\\xa0 directs large amounts of fluid from your\\xa0\\nbloodstream into the site of an infection.\\xa0\\xa0 So as the battle rages on without a clear\\xa0\\nwinner, more and more fluid enters the brain. At this point the human will feel\\xa0\\nsymptoms that quickly escalate.\\xa0\\xa0 It all begins pretty vaguely, a headache, fever,\\xa0\\xa0 nausea and vomiting. As the battle spreads\\xa0\\nrapidly through the brain serious symptoms appear,\\xa0\\xa0 from confusion, inability to concentrate\\xa0\\nto fatigue, seizures and hallucinations.\\xa0\\xa0 The brain swells up massively but can’t expand due\\xa0\\nto the bones surrounding it. So it compresses and\\xa0\\xa0 disables the brainstem that controls things like\\xa0\\nbreathing. Usually within a week the patient dies. Up to 97% of patients infected by the\\xa0\\namoeba share this fate. In almost all cases,\\xa0\\xa0 by the time an infection by Naegleria fowleri is\\xa0\\nrecognized the disastrous battle for the brain\\xa0\\xa0 is already so far along that there is almost\\xa0\\nnothing to be done. Not only do we currently\\xa0\\xa0 not have effective treatments, there are also an\\xa0\\nabundance of open questions about how an amoeba\\xa0\\xa0 that usually enjoys its life in open water, is\\xa0\\nable to overcome our immune system so effectively. So how worried do you need to be about this\\xa0\\nhorrifying killer amoeba? Well, not very. While\\xa0\\xa0 the Naegleria fowleri is clearly extremely deadly\\xa0\\nand the infection truly horrible, there have only\\xa0\\xa0 been a few hundred cases in the last few decades.\\xa0\\nYou are way more likely to drown in a pool than\\xa0\\xa0 to get infected. Not only does the amoeba need\\xa0\\nto be flushed high up your nose, it also needs\\xa0\\xa0 to get a good grip and it also has to make its\\xa0\\nway through the first lines of your defences. Ultimately Naegleria fowleri is neither evil\\xa0\\nnor a huge public health risk. But every year\\xa0\\xa0 some unlucky people have to deal with it. We still\\xa0\\nhave so much to learn about it and until we find a\\xa0\\xa0 way to treat it, Naegleria fowleri will continue\\xa0\\nto be this vague and horrifying thing, hunting\\xa0\\xa0 in puddles and lakes and sometimes pools. Usually\\xa0\\nfor bacteria. And very occasionally, for people. - Oh hey, who are you? It is me, your existential dread! - Uhm, ok. I'm here to make you question your own\\xa0\\nexistence and everything you hold dear in life! - Could you not please.

runaway warming and we may soon hit tipping points that will lead to the collapse of ecosystems and our civilization while scientists activists and much of the younger generation urge action it appears most politicians are not committed to doing anything meaningful while the fossil fuel industry still works actively against change it seems Humanity can't overcome its greed and obsession with short-term profit and personal gain to save itself and so for many the future looks grim and hopeless young people feel particularly anxious and depressed instead of looking ahead to a lifetime of opportunity they wonder if they will even have a future or if they should bring kids into this world it's an age of Doom and hopelessness and giving up seems the only sensible thing to do but that's not true you are not doomed humanity is not [Music] doomed despite the seriousness of the situation for years positive Trends have accumulated and there is finally some good news and a clear path towards our Collective climate goals Welcome to our Ted Talk please watch this video to the end check out our detailed sources afterwards to learn learn more okay let's start with the scariest things cancelling the apocalypse some of the most widely shared stories about climate change are that it is an existential threat the end of human civilization and maybe even our own Extinction event and that it's basically unavoidable now but what does science actually say as of 20122 the global average temperature has risen 1.2 de C compared to pre-industrial times limiting warming to 1.5° was the most ambitious goal of the Paris agreement but we are not likely to meet it already with the warming we have today hot places will get hotter wet places wetter and the risk and strength of extreme weather events increase significantly warming Beyond 2° makes all of these extremes more extreme extreme weather events more common with more ecosystems under major pressure some will not survive at 3° significant parts of Earth especially in developing countries might become unable to feed their populations heat waves will become a major Global issue large scale natural systems will break down the scale and frequency of hurricans fires and droughts will further increase and cause trillions in damage poor regions and subsistence farmers will be hit the hardest hundreds of millions of people will need to leave their homes in the 4 to 8° range the apocalypse begins the hot house Earth where things change so quickly that it may become unable to support our large human population and billions May perish leaving the rest on a hostile Alien Planet a decade ago for lack of action and perspective many scientists assumed a four plus degree world was our future and a lot of Public Communication focused on exactly this Future Path luckily it's much less likely that this version of the Apocalypse will come to pass if current climate policies stagnate we're likely to end up with warming of around 3° C by 2,100 which is scary and tragic and far from acceptable but this is actually good news how in the last decade we've seen enough progress that most scientists now think that we have likely avoided apocalyptic climate change although substantial risk Still Remains we can pretty confidently say that Humanity isn't going anywhere civilization might have to change but it will endure which begs the question what has changed over the last 10 years and is this really good news the invisible shift you probably know this story the last decade has been an immense failure for climate policies around the world instead of passing comprehensive binding bills that would meaningfully reduce emissions we mostly did nothing a loss decade with one negative record after another and this story is true as and it's one reason why so many people are giving up but it is not the whole picture despite the lack of climate policies and ongoing lobbying and misinformation campaigns from the fossil fuel Industries there was a lot of progress let's go back 20 years to see why today is so different between 2000 and 2010 greenhouse gas emissions had grown by 24% three times as much as the increase in the previous decade subsidies for fossil fuels aimed at promoting economic growth caused a colossal increase in their consumption for developing countries like China and India coal was the cheapest fuel for growth while rich countries showed little interest in changing their ways in 2010 many people expected these Trends to continue instead of decreasing fossil fuel use its consumption would rise the next decade turned out to be very different though first of all coal burning in developing countries like India has slowed down or leveled off like in China and it's plummeted in rich countries like the UK and us since 2015 34s of planned coal plants have been canceled and 44 countries have committed to stop building them 10 years ago that would have seemed like wishful thinking but today we can say with confidence coal is dying it's just not competitive anymore because Technologies we thought would remain expensive matured rapidly instead renewable electricity has shown explosive progress in a mere decade wind energy got three times cheaper solar electricity is now 10 times cheaper cheaper than coal or any other fossil fuel burning power plant despite the massive subsidies and Global infrastructure propping up fossil fuels 25 times more solar and nearly five times more wind electricity is produced today compared with 10 years ago which is of course not nearly enough one of the biggest obstacles is the variability of their power output renew need a lot of energy storage to be a reliable power source like expensive batteries amazingly battery prices have decreased by 97% in the past 30 years 60% in the last decade alone which will serve all kinds of Green Technology like electric cars you might say well that's great but didn't kot kazak's last climate video say that while wind and solar are nice we need nothing less than a fundamental transition of our Global industrial system yes but luckily the shift goes beyond just the energy sector throughout the economy people are working on improving current technology to lower emissions we're rapidly replacing old incandescent light bulbs with LEDs that are 10 times more efficient in 2020 about 7 out of 10 new cars in Norway were electric or hybrid in 2021 it was already eight out of 10 and the list goes on from electric heating and better insulation to ships traveling at half speed to save fuel wherever you look you find scientists engineers and entrepreneurs trying to solve some aspect of climate change enormous amounts of human Ingenuity are being brought to bear on this problem with more and more people deciding to prioritize preventing rapid climate change solutions for low carbon production of cement electronics and steel and Innovations like artificial meat and carbon capture are in the works the more of these Technologies we deploy the cheaper new and better technology gets the cheaper they get the more people use them and so on we can see the impact already the domestic CO2 output of rich countries is falling without a major recession since the year 2000 the EU as a whole shows a 21% decrease Italy 28% the UK 35% Denmark 43% but the best news may be that emissions are no longer necessarily coupled with the economic growth in the past this Was An Inconvenient Truth to get richer you had to emit more which led to Fierce arguments between developing and developed countries about the fairness of reducing emissions while their populations were still poor but in the last decade we've seen that it is possible to increase Prosperity without increasing emissions emissions in the Czech Republic dropped 13% while their GDP grew by 27% France reduced their CO2 emissions by 14% while increasing GDP by 15% Romania saw an 8% decrease and 35 5% growth and even the largest economy on Earth the USA decreased emissions by 4% while growing their GDP by 26% some of you may call this a numbers trick that rich countries are just exporting emissions to poorer Nations by moving the dirty parts of their economies like manufacturing but even when we account for all of our imported goods the numbers still look positive it's no longer a matter of having to choose between prosperity and the climate as it seemed to be a decade ago developing countries will profit from that because as rich countries pay for the expensive development of green technologies they can adopt them more cheaply they can skip most of the high emission phase that today's rich countries went through we are at the point where not decarbonizing is a bad business decision and we haven't even really talked about Solutions like carbon capture in 2000 it didn't really exist in 2022 that technology does exist and costs around $600 to remove one ton of CO2 from the atmosphere as investment pours in and the technology matures and begins to scale it's likely that these costs will plummet over the next few decades so everything's fine then well let's not get carried away all of these processes are great but not nearly fast enough we're still doing way too little and Technology will not magically solve everything we need to use fewer resources and use them longer design consumer goods that are repairable and durable and decrease our energy requirements we need much better infrastructure Agriculture and cities it will still be hard work especially to get the right policies passed and enacted but for the first time ever there are a few trend lines pointing solidly in the right direction and now imagine if all of this was achieved without proper financial and political support and despite fossil fuel lobbying just think what Humanity can do when climate change finally gets the political attention and funding it needs so is it okay to feel hopeful again the situation is still dire and serious so what's the point of focusing on this side of the story The Trap of hopelessness climate change can feel overwhelming and make your future seem Bleak the sadness and hopelessness that many people feel is real and very destructive because it causes apathy apathy that is only serving the fossil fuel industry that is still delaying change however it can in a sense they have weaponized hopelessness we are now in phase four in the public debate about rapid climate change action phase one was climate change is not real phase two was climate change is real but not caused by humans phase three was climate change may be caused by humans but it's not that bad phase four is climate change is no longer avoidable we are doomed and it doesn't matter what we do if we want the World to Change we first need to believe that change is possible and we have an abundance of evidence that it is changes to our industrial system are gaining momentum technology gets better and cheaper climate change has become a key issue in most free elections as more and more younger people move into influential positions they prioritize climate change and work on new Solutions in 2022 most governments not only acknowledge it but set their own Net Zero goals in Democratic and autocratic countries the results of years of fighting a steep uphill battle are now clearly visible the pressure needs to keep increasing to make sure that the promises made today are actually kept climate doomeris is the equivalent of giving up even though you can still prevent not just the worst case but also mitigate most of the bad things make changes in time to adapt better and prevent the poorest from suffering that is why hopelessness and apathy are so dangerous if the last in any ways wasted decade has shown anything then it's that progress is being made and that dire scenarios are just predictions not our sealed fate as of 2022 based on current Global policies we will end up in a 3° world now it's our job to yet again prove the predictions wrong despite how serious and urgent things are to turn that 3° into a two de and then see where we can go from there for that we need hope and we hope we gave you that today at least a little that you feel that things are serious but also that you have a future that you could have kids without dooming them or the world that taking action today is worth it and that despite powerful Industries doing everything to delay it Society is changing if you need a more concrete road mapap of what you can do personally we're working on a follow-up video to talk about that in Greater detail weaponized hopelessness are the only Trump cards left for the powers that don't want change don't let them win [Music]\", \"When we think about alien civilizations we\\xa0\\ntend to look into the vastness of space,\\xa0\\xa0 to far away planets. But there is another\\xa0\\xa0 incredibly vast dimension that we might\\xa0\\nbe giving too little thought to: time. Could it be that over the last\\xa0\\nhundreds of millions of years,\\xa0\\xa0 other civilizations existed on earth?\\xa0\\nIndigenous technological species that\\xa0\\xa0 rose and died out? And that they or\\xa0\\ntheir artifacts are buried beneath\\xa0\\xa0 our feet? What does science have to say about\\xa0\\nthis and what are the implications for us? Life on earth has existed for 4 billion\\xa0\\nyears, mostly as single celled organisms\\xa0\\xa0 until some 540 million years ago the Cambrian\\xa0\\nexplosion heralded the age of animals. A huge\\xa0\\xa0 time window for our indigenous aliens. Where would\\xa0\\nwe look for them and what could we hope to find?\\xa0\\xa0 Sadly we have only one\\xa0\\ncivilization to look at: Ourselves. Anatomically modern humans emerged around\\xa0\\n300,000 years ago and probably lived in small\\xa0\\xa0 groups of hunter gatherers, slowly spreading\\xa0\\naround the world. Progress was slow and our\\xa0\\xa0 lifestyle did not change much, although there\\xa0\\nmay have been local bursts of complexity. Until about 10,000 years ago, when\\xa0\\nthe agricultural revolution changed\\xa0\\xa0 our lifestyle forever, enabling massive\\xa0\\npopulation growth and technological progress.\\xa0\\xa0 Rather than just animals with culture and tools\\xa0\\nthat would have been invisible from space,\\xa0\\xa0 we changed the face of the\\xa0\\nplanet, cleared forests and\\xa0\\xa0 constructed cities and temples for our\\xa0\\ngods at breathtaking speeds and scales. Until about 300 years ago, we became\\xa0\\nan industrial species and yet again\\xa0\\xa0 our numbers grew exponentially\\xa0\\nas did our impact on the planet. We could say that our 300,000 year\\xa0\\nlong history has three phases:\\xa0\\xa0 We were hunter gatherers for 97%, farmers for\\xa0\\n2.9% and industrialists for 0.1% of our history. And yet we are super new on earth.\\xa0\\xa0 On geological timescales, even the sturdiest\\xa0\\nthings lose their durability. The oldest large\\xa0\\xa0 scale surface is in the Negev Desert, a meager\\xa0\\n1.8 million years old. Everything older has been\\xa0\\xa0 crushed to dust or turned over and it is either\\xa0\\nbelow the ground, or covered by ice or ocean.\\xa0\\xa0 Our age, the Anthropocene will be a layer only\\xa0\\na few centimeters thick in a few million years. If there were aliens before us and they\\xa0\\ntoo went through these three phases,\\xa0\\xa0 what would remain of them? What can we learn\\xa0\\nabout indegnous aliens by looking at ourselves? Hunter & Gatherer Aliens We actually know that in the last few million\\xa0\\nyears, there were hunter gatherers aliens.\\xa0\\xa0 Our ancestors like Homo Erectus and cousins like\\xa0\\nthe Neanderthals or Denisovans and probably many\\xa0\\xa0 more that we haven’t found yet or are lost to\\xa0\\ntime forever. They left fragments of their bodies,\\xa0\\xa0 of weapons and tools and even art. Considering how\\xa0\\nlong they existed and how little remains of them,\\xa0\\xa0 although they lived not that far from our present\\xa0\\nit is easy to think there have been others. Intelligent animals like us that could talk and\\xa0\\nuse tools and fire, that had culture and art. For\\xa0\\xa0 the last two million years, most hominins lived as\\xa0\\nhunter-gatherers – so if these aliens never moved\\xa0\\xa0 up higher on the tech tree, hundreds of different\\xa0\\nspecies and cultures could have existed without\\xa0\\xa0 leaving any traces. Their artifacts lost to\\xa0\\nbiological and then geological processes.\\xa0\\xa0 At worst they would leave absolutely nothing\\xa0\\nto be found after thousands of years. But what about fossils? We talked about how\\xa0\\nunlikely the process of fossilization is in more\\xa0\\xa0 detail in our dinosaur video, but in a nutshell,\\xa0\\nper hundred thousand years of earth's history\\xa0\\xa0 we only get a handful of good fossils. So we might\\xa0\\neasily just miss fossils of such people – but even\\xa0\\xa0 if we had any, we would not necessarily be\\xa0\\nable to identify them as hunter gatherers. Agricultural and Empire Aliens Looking at humans again, agricultural societies\\xa0\\nleft much more to be dug up and found,\\xa0\\xa0 because they used more sophisticated tools made\\xa0\\nfrom sturdier materials and had to feed millions,\\xa0\\xa0 leaving many more artifacts. Farming\\xa0\\nallowed them to specialize and develop tech\\xa0\\xa0 from writing to navigation, architecture\\xa0\\nand government. Over thousands of years city\\xa0\\xa0 states became kingdoms and empires, some\\xa0\\nexisting for millennia before they fell. Many of the buildings or monuments\\xa0\\nthey constructed are still around\\xa0\\xa0 and traces of them will exist for a few thousand\\xa0\\nmore years. Some only as outlines in the ground,\\xa0\\xa0 but still recognizable to future archaeologists.\\xa0\\nThe pyramids are piles of limestone so massive\\xa0\\xa0 that they will probably be around for hundreds\\xa0\\nof thousands of years. And because of the\\xa0\\xa0 greater numbers of humans that lived during our\\xa0\\nfarm and empire period, we can expect way more\\xa0\\xa0 fossils and artifacts to be detectable, maybe\\xa0\\nfor a few million years before they vanish. So we can say with confidence that no such\\xa0\\nindigenous alien civilization existed in the\\xa0\\xa0 last few million years because otherwise we\\xa0\\nwould have found something that they left. This still leaves a window of hundreds of millions\\xa0\\nof years, back to the emergence of complex life,\\xa0\\xa0 where we would not be able to tell. If there were\\xa0\\nalien pre industrial societies and empires on the\\xa0\\xa0 level of the ancient Romans or Chinese, they would\\xa0\\nhave likely disappeared without a trace. Their\\xa0\\xa0 tools, even advanced metals, would have rotted\\xa0\\naway. If they dug up canals, cleared forests and\\xa0\\xa0 built cities, their traces would be very hard to\\xa0\\ndistinguish from nature. Maybe there once was an\\xa0\\xa0 empire of cephalopods occupying impressive cities\\xa0\\nin swamps and lakes, made from wood and stone.\\xa0\\xa0 Their engineers flooding land to build wet cities,\\xa0\\ntheir poets reciting poems in a language of\\xa0\\xa0 colors. Maybe they never industrialized – maybe\\xa0\\ntheir society was too stable or not inventive\\xa0\\xa0 enough or they never got a chance. A single\\xa0\\nevent like an asteroid, an epidemic or an ice age\\xa0\\xa0 could just have deleted their civilization,\\xa0\\nground up their temples as their soft bodies\\xa0\\xa0 rotted away. Sadly we don’t have the tiniest\\xa0\\namount of evidence for any such civilization. After a few million years at best, their\\xa0\\nachievements would have dissolved into nothing. Industrial Indigenous Aliens What about industrial civilizations,\\xa0\\nlike humanity today? Imagine humans\\xa0\\xa0 died out suddenly, through a pandemic or cosmic\\xa0\\nrays or something like that. What would remain? Our impact on the planet is orders of\\xa0\\nmagnitude greater than that of our ancestors.\\xa0\\xa0 The fossil record will show a\\xa0\\ngreat extinction of wildlife\\xa0\\xa0 and an explosion of fossils from human associated\\xa0\\nanimals, like rats, cows, pigs and chickens.\\xa0\\xa0 Like the structures of our ancestors, skyscrapers\\xa0\\nand streets and harddrives will basically crumble\\xa0\\xa0 into nothingness in a few millennia. But\\xa0\\nbecause there were so many humans everywhere,\\xa0\\xa0 for a few million years after our sudden end,\\xa0\\nthere would be clear hints of our existence. The byproducts of our industrial lifestyle might\\xa0\\xa0 actually give us away for some\\xa0\\nhundreds of millions of years . We use massive amounts of artificial fertilizer\\xa0\\nwhich redirects earth’s flow of nitrogen that\\xa0\\xa0 is being deposited in the soil. Mining metals\\xa0\\nand rare Earth elements leaves long term scars\\xa0\\xa0 and depletes natural resources. We saturate\\xa0\\nour oceans with plastics that find their way\\xa0\\xa0 to the ocean floor and may persist\\xa0\\nfor hundreds of millions of years.\\xa0\\xa0 There are radioactive elements and their decay,\\xa0\\nunnatural accumulations of elements that do not\\xa0\\xa0 exist outside labs or weapons. And of course, in\\xa0\\nour short industrial history we have changed the\\xa0\\xa0 proportion of CO2 in the air by burning massive\\xa0\\namounts of fossil fuels, increasing the acidity\\xa0\\xa0 of the oceans and so on. We may already\\xa0\\nhave left a mark in the geological record. So far we have found no traces of\\xa0\\nan industrial alien civilization.\\xa0\\xa0 No layers of weird chemicals or displaced\\xa0\\nelements. No radioactive layer to indicate\\xa0\\xa0 that once great nations waged nuclear\\xa0\\nwar. We do see mass extinctions and\\xa0\\xa0 massive shifts in the fossil records but no\\xa0\\nevidence that they did not occur naturally. And ironically we’ve hit upon an interesting\\xa0\\nproblem here: If industrial societies stress the\\xa0\\xa0 ecosystem enough to cause their own extinction,\\xa0\\nthey won’t be around that long. But if they become\\xa0\\xa0 sustainable their imprint on the geological record\\xa0\\nmay be tiny. If past industrial civilizations were\\xa0\\xa0 sustainable before they died out, we may have\\xa0\\nlittle to no chance of ever knowing about them. In any case, over hundreds of millions\\xa0\\nof years these signatures may become\\xa0\\xa0 very subtle and get overlooked or interpreted as\\xa0\\nnatural. Even if an industrialized alien society\\xa0\\xa0 existed 200 million years ago and lasted\\xa0\\nfor 100,000 years, 300 times longer than\\xa0\\xa0 industrial humanity, it still might be\\xa0\\neasy to miss it in the geological record. In any case, all of this is speculation. In\\xa0\\nthe end we should not use our imagination to\\xa0\\xa0 trick ourselves into thinking we know anything\\xa0\\nabout our blind spots. Just assuming a thing\\xa0\\xa0 happened because we don’t have evidence\\xa0\\nagainst it is a trap we should avoid. So for now, if we look at the\\xa0\\nvastness of time it seems as\\xa0\\xa0 devoid of aliens as the vastness of space. Maybe\\xa0\\nwe are alone in this universe and always were.\\xa0\\xa0 Maybe we’ll find traces of others eventually, we\\xa0\\ndon’t know. But there is one important takeaway:\\xa0\\xa0 The continuation of our civilization is\\xa0\\nnot guaranteed and if we are not careful,\\xa0\\xa0 we may disappear forever. Let’s\\xa0\\nhope that in a few million years,\\xa0\\xa0 there won't be another civilization\\xa0\\nstudying our layer in the fossil record.\", \"today we are answering an age-old very scientific and important question what if the moon crashes into Earth it's more interesting and weird than you probably think let's start with the basics why isn't the moon on its way to crash into us [Music] already we know that Earth's gravity pulls everything towards it including the moon but somehow it stays up as if suspended by some opposite Force but there is no other Force countering gravity instead the trick to staying up is a sideways motion that we call an orbit you see orbits every day when you throw a ball it makes a tiny little orbit the only difference between the ball's orbit and the moon's is that the ball eventually hits the ground basically the reason is speed if you could throw your ball fast enough it would bend around the the world and come back to you if there were no air slowing it down it could orbit forever and this is what the moon does falling sideways around Earth very fast with no air slowing it down orbiting Earth every 27 days at 3,600 km an hour so for the moon to just stop in its orbit and plummet to the Earth would break more laws of physics than we have time to explain so how do we crash it into Earth in a nutshell to change an object's or it you need to change its speed which changes where gravity takes it but even small changes require enormous forces which is why all the large objects in the solar system are so stable nowadays according to science the moon is big and very massive even igniting billions of Rocket engines all over its surface would barely move the Moon it looks like nothing short of magic will make the moon fall so we'll use a magic spell that slows down the moon so much that it changes its orbit and spirals towards Earth to get the most from the experience the moon will take exactly 1 year before it hits Earth ready 3 2 1 magic month one for the first few days nothing really changes the moon gets a tiny bit brighter and scientists get confused but the rest of us don't notice anything different the only noticeable real effect of the moon on the Earth are the tides Tides exist because while Earth pulls on the moon the moon's gravity pulls back on the earth since the strength of gravity gets weaker with distance different parts of the earth feel a slightly different pull which causes the Earth especially the oceans to bulge when the moon is above them and contract a little on the sides when it's not as Earth rotates every day underneath the moon the moon's influence fluctuat causing the water level of the oceans to Rise and Fall by about half a meter twice a day but with the moon drawing ever closer high tide gets higher every day at first barely noticeable within a month the moon has covered half the distance to the Earth and ocean tides have grown to 4 M every day high tide comes and waves flood coastal cities and there's no end in sight with the moon drawing ever closer Tides rise ever higher inundating another city and more inhabited land with salty water every day month two by the end of month 2 the moon has covered 2/3 of the distance to Earth and Global infrastructure is crumbling as Tides rise above 10 m displacing up to a billion people who happen to live near the coastlines as ports become inoperable shipping grinds to a halt not only will it slow down the delivery of quazar products but also less exciting things like food Global Communications fall into disarray 95% of the internet is carried by ocean Crossing cables and while these largely don't mind the water their terminals on land do living in land doesn't guarantee safety either tidal boards cause rivers to flow backwards carrying salt water to contaminate surface and groundwater supplies gas shortages follow as all refineries near the coast are abandoned countries are left with the supplies they had on their shelves and strict rationing will begin in the cities chaos rains during the Scavenging hours of low tide while survivors take refuge in highrises when the water returns month three 3 months in and the Moon is close enough to disrupt communication and navigation satellites while it's normally far too distant for its gravity to cause any major problems for our satellites The Closer it gets the more warped their orbits become as their fuel for orbital Corrections Runs Out satellites coren out of control months four and five on Earth the tides are rapidly growing to about 30 m and will be reaching 100 m in height in a few short weeks at low tide the ocean recedes hundreds of kilometers exposing the continental shelf like vast deserts while at high tide walls of water drown agriculture houses and skyscrapers and now almost 5 months in the apocalypse has finished its warmup act since the oceans are on average only 3 km deep the tides have reached their maximum up until now the water in the oceans could flow absorbing most of the moon's gravitational squeezing but now the Earth itself is ready feeling the squeeze of the ever approaching Moon these aren't so much tides of water but tides of rock the squeezing of the planet combined with the weight of quenti of tons of water sloshing on and off the tectonic plate creates enormous stresses below and begins to cause earthquakes of increasing magnitude and intensity it's impossible ble to say how serious these earthquakes might be or where they occur but like a child jumping on their bed Until It Breaks no good can come of it strong tidal forces lead to volcanism on other planets and moons on Earth squeezing the planet disrupts the magma reservoirs inside the crust triggering sizable climate altering eruptions in Chile New Zealand Yellowstone and elsewhere meanwhile watching patiently above is the moon still no bigger in the sky than a small Cloud within 75,000 km of Earth it is bright enough to illuminate the night sky like Twilight months 6 and 7 after half a year the Moon is entering the space once occupied by geosynchronous satellites where it orbits Earth every 24 hours it appears to float at one spot in the sky unmoving cycling through a full set of phases every day but only visible to half the planet with the moon stationary above the Earth the tide it seemed to freeze in place half the world flooded half with its water seemingly returned to the Sea as if Earth is holding its breath to prepare for the worst as the moon sinks further you might wonder if its gravity would overpower Earths pulling you up and ending your misery fortunately not the Earth's surface gravity is about six times stronger than the moon so even if the moon were hovering right on top of you you would still stay on the ground on the moon things are different though the near Side of the Moon is more strongly affected by Earth's gravity so during the next few months it starts to stretch forward towards the earth into something of an egg triggering deep moonquakes as the lunar Rock flexes and changes shape though barely noticeable now this squish will grow to hundreds of kilometers in a matter of months Months 8 to 11 at this point the apocalypse has arrived and we can summarize the months before the crash as everybody left has a bad time the tides sweeping over the Earth slow down and then reverse their Direction because the moon now orbits Earth faster than it rotates the planet will experience an abundance of earthquakes and volcanism massive amounts of volcanic Aerosoles rise High into the stratosphere shiny enough to reflect sunlight back into space what little light gets through is rust red and is periodically diminished by daily eclipses the result is a rapid global cooling with acid rains and summer snows killing even the hardest plants the clock runs out on civilization billions have perished while an x-shaped moon is still drawing closer let's get ready for the grand finale month 12 finally at the end of the year the moon has reached the rash limit that's the point where Earth's gravitational pull on the moon is stronger than the moon's own gravity things on the lunar surface start falling towards Earth and and by the time it crosses 10,000 km the entire Moon disintegrates into Rubble smearing itself into a massive ring system around the earth fortunately the moon's disintegration means the misery on Earth has ended no moon means the general apocalyptic nature of things comes to a halt the oceans recede flowing off the land one last time any survivors are treated to a view of tremendous arches spanning the sky glimmering in the Sun light Illuminating the night sky more brilliantly than any full moon ever could while meteor showers of moond dust fill the sky it's hard to say what happens next but the Tranquility may be shortlived if too much moond dust rains down friction heats the atmosphere possibly boiling the oceans if not the enormous Shadows cast by the Rings combined with all the volcanic and meteoric aerosols block even more sunlight and a period of runaway cooling could begin the freezes much of earth's surface solid in any case at some point people will emerge again from submarines or bunkers or mountaintops they will not have a great time before rebuilding civilization and their success is not guaranteed but at least they'll be trying to do so with beautiful rings in the sky\", \"The Universe is incredibly big and seems full\\nof potential for life, with billions of habitable planets. If an advanced civilization had the technology\\nto travel between the stars, at just 0.1% of the speed of light, It could colonize our\\ngalaxy in roughly 100 million years. Which is not that long given the billions\\nof years the milky way has existed – so in principle any spacefaring civilization\\nshould be able to spread rapidly over huge sectors of the galaxy. And yet we see nothing, hear nothing, the\\nuniverse seems empty. Devoid of others. This is the Fermi Paradox, which we have discussed\\nin more detail in other videos. Confronted with the seemingly empty universe,\\nhumanity faces a dilemma. We desperately want to know if we are alone\\nin the Milky Way. We want to call out and reveal ourselves to\\nanyone watching but that could be the last thing we ever do. Because maybe the universe is not empty. Maybe it’s full of civilizations but they\\nare hiding from each other. Maybe the civilizations that attracted attention\\nin the past were wiped away by invisible arrows. This is the Dark Forest solution to the Fermi\\nparadox. The Way Of Life The hunter awakes in his hiding place and\\ncarefully listens for suspicious noises from the thick undergrowth before he gets up. Another night has passed without incident. The forest is dark and full of fog. He considers calling out to others to end\\nhis loneliness but stops himself at the last moment. What if they are like him? All living things seek to survive, secure\\nresources and multiply. Their greatest obstacle are other living things\\nthat share the same objective. Competition between species favored the survival\\nof beings with advantageous traits. Our ancestors were inventive, competitive,\\nexpansionist and greedy for resources, which led to them winning the competition for our\\nplanet. Today, most other animals are so utterly at\\nour mercy that we wipe out about a dozen species a day, just as an unintentional byproduct\\nof how we like to run things. But humans are more than individuals. From us cultures emerge, that also compete\\nwith each other. Competitive and expansionary cultures spread\\nfaster and further and merge with, subdue or destroy others. If we look at our history it becomes clear:\\nWe are dangerous. Not just to others but also to ourselves. Our human nature has driven us to take over\\nevery corner of our planet and soon we will look to the stars, both to expand our domain\\nand ensure access to ever more resources. And then we might stumble upon others trying\\nto do the same thing. It is likely that the competition of life\\nalso takes place on far away planets, so it is logical to assume that an alien civilization\\nthat came to dominate their planet would be in some regards similar to us. But if they are similar to us, they, too,\\nmay be dangerous. The Implication As the hunter sneaks through the dark forest\\nall alone he knows that there might be others like him. He can’t know their intentions, if they\\nare aggressive or not. The hunter knows he would kill to ensure his\\nown survival, so he has to assume that they would too. And it might be that if he stumbles upon another\\nhunter, the one that shoots first survives. None of this means that conflict is unavoidable. So far the progress of the modern world seems\\nto have made us more peaceful, not more violent. Maybe this is true for other civilizations\\ntoo, that eventually progress means less conflict, not more. Different alien civilizations also should\\nvary from the mild and peaceful to the malevolent and militaristic. The existential problem we are facing is that\\nwhen we meet others between the stars, we have no way of telling who is peaceful or\\naggressive and what their true intentions are. Similarly, they might not understand or trust\\nour intentions even if we tell them that we are peaceful. On top of that, if we did discover another\\ncivilization, and they discovered us, the light years between us would mean years of\\ncommunication delay. Both sides would be in a state of uncertainty,\\nwondering if the wisest move is to just attack, because there's another serious issue: technological\\nexplosions and first strike advantage. We do not know where the limits of technology\\nare, but we do know how much technological progress matters in war. A few hundred or thousand years can turn conflict\\nwith uncertain results into a one sided massacre. Caesar's legions would stand no chance against\\nNapoleon's army with their cannons and muskets. Which would be eradicated by artillery from\\nthe first world war. Which would not stand a chance against today's\\ndrones and guided missiles. So the power level of different civilizations\\nmay vary massively and even if not, between the time it takes us to detect another civilization\\nand us saying “hi” we might already be hopelessly behind on the tech tree. Which is bad enough, but the nature of interstellar\\nconflict makes this worse. If your opponent is light years away, sending\\nan invasion fleet takes so long that by the time it arrives it might be hopelessly obsolete. So, war between civilizations might be just\\nabout eliminating the other to remove an existential threat to yourself. Someone else who might be so scared of you\\nthat they attack the first chance they get. In this environment, the only way to guarantee\\na win is to strike with such force and speed that the target has no chance of survival\\nor time to counter-attack or escape to seek revenge later. The stakes are the highest possible with no\\nroom for error. If we assume that the majority of civilizations\\nlive on planets that leaves them pretty vulnerable – all you need to do is throw something\\nmassive at a planet to make it uninhabitable. So the ultimate interplanetary annihilation\\nweapon is probably something like a Relativistic Kill Vehicle – a missile shot at a planet\\nat a significant fraction of the speed of light. For example, a missile the size of a person\\ngoing 95% the speed of light has as much energy as all nuclear bombs on earth. If you shot a few dozen at the civilization\\nyou wanted to wipe out, success would be fairly certain – even a single hit would suffice. This is not that absurd of an idea – a civilization\\nonly slightly above us on the Kardashev scale would have enough energy to send multiple\\nstrikes against every planet it suspects of harboring life. What makes these weapons so sinister is how\\nmuch they favor a first strike, since they would be so fast that it might be impossible\\nto protect yourself effectively against them once they’re launched. Conflict between civilizations may not be\\nlengthy affairs but rapid winner takes all situations, where the first one to shoot wins. This makes any civilization an existential\\nthreat to any other. And if every civilization is an existential\\nthreat to every other, there may be only two kinds of civilizations out there: quiet ones\\nand dead ones. So what should we do? So, should we worry? It is unlikely that anybody has noticed humanity\\nyet. The radio signals we’ve transmitted in the\\nlast 100 years traveled a relatively tiny distance and have long decayed into unreadable\\nnoise. At our technological stage, if we don’t\\nactively try to get noticed and if nobody specifically looks at our pretty unremarkable\\nsolar system, we’ll stay hidden. But one day we will venture into space in\\na serious way and need to consider these kinds of questions again. We don’t know if there are others or if\\nwe are going through the forest alone. But we have no way of knowing for sure. For the time being, it seems the best we can\\ndo is to carefully listen. And even if we see others step into a clearing\\nand make themselves known, we should not reply right away but carefully watch them from the\\nundergrowth. Perhaps we are also thinking about this all\\nwrong by allowing our primitive brain, that evolved in the context of the gruesome competition\\nof life, to conjure fears of predatory aliens all around us. Maybe the fact that we are looking at the\\nuniverse like this is a sign that we are not grown up yet as a species. There could be a friendly, welcoming community\\nof alien civilizations waiting to hear from us when we are ready. As for now, the good news is there is actually\\nlittle we need to do. We just need to be thoughtful about the signals\\nwe send out into the galaxy, we need to watch the sky and learn more about our galaxy, our\\nforest. Because whatever the nature of our forest\\nis, full of dangers or friends, or nobody at all, only careful observation can tell. So let’s do that. At last the hunter reaches a clearing and\\nfinds a comfortable position. Slowly the sun melts the fog away, lost in\\nthought he admires the vegetation until suddenly – he is eye to eye with another hunter,\\nfrozen in terror just like himself. His mind is racing, considering all the different\\noptions. The hunter takes a deep breath and makes a\\ndecision.\", \"qus gazar is lying to you in every video even in this one because our videos distill very complex subjects into flashy 10-minute pieces and unfortunately reality is well complicated the question of how we deal with that is Central to what we do on this channel and something we think about a lot [Music] what we mean by lying is the concept of lies to Children the idea that on the path to explaining something complicated you start off with a little lie a useful oversimplification that makes it easier to grasp a concept for example as a kid you learn that the Earth is a sphere orbiting the Sun with Planet bodies but it's not actually a sphere and the bodies are super different in size and not close to each other at all by beginning at a place of oversimplification your building a framework a foundation that you can then build upon and add nuance and complexity later on step by step you're getting towards the real gist of the complicated subject science communication has to use lies to children to some degree or it turns into Science Education and getting a proper education in all of the scientific Fields would take years of intense study to become fluent in them as a species we have a major interest in summarizing science and its advancements and educating as many people about it as possible because we all benefit if more people have a fact-based scientific worldview we will discuss what science is and how it works in different videos in more detail but for now let's just say it's a process to advance organize predict and test our knowledge about the universe if you understand the current state of scientific knowledge then you can make better decisions based on facts and testable ideas rather than outdated belief system or our intuition that evolved to protect our ancestors from Lions but is no longer suited for the complexity of our modern world our brains are comically ill prepared to navigate the fast moving world we happen to live in today a world ironically created by science a few hundred years ago it was possible to be knowledgeable at an expert level in pretty much every field of study in the information age this is a futile Endeavor since knowledge and data are increasing exponentially so to even have a chance of grasping the world we live in we need summaries that give us if not a true understanding of all the details a solid overview explaining science to many people is not about enlightening the ignorant but necessary for the progress of our species at large to make this possible we need to find metaphors and stories that capture the true nature of things as much as possible while using a language that our brains can deal with a great example here is physics quarks are often depicted as blue red and green with different spins but just saying Spin and using colors forces our brain to imagine colorful spinning balls which is great to visualize the different types and the relationships between quarks but also creates a very wrong image of reality in our heads molecules are nothing like the neat diagrams that we're taught in school but buzzing and vibrating entities held together by something we call charge that describes how certain things want to be close or Escape each other for some unknown reason we're describing phenomena that we are pretty sure exist in some form or another because the maths works out and we can do real world experiments and predict their results before we do them in reality these are models tricks to summarize what we know and make up a coherent story and prepare the ground for more in-depth explanations don't confuse the description of a thing for the thing itself simplifications like these are not just meant to dumb things down they're actually useful for experts themselves for example chemists who use wrong electron shell models to work out chemical bonds or scientists using simplified models as the basis for discussion with colleagues across different scientific Fields but the simplification of science can also be problematic for a bunch of reasons finding the true nature of reality is super hard because our brains did not evolve for this job and the universe doesn't care if we understand it science is a process to work towards gaining knowledge and not an absolute truth generator the answers it provides are multi-layered and nuance and that complexity can get lost when it's simplified especially when it's done so for headlines an interesting cancer study turns into a potential cure a healthy food becomes the basis for a new diet such simplifications give a misleading definiteness to science which goes against its process like nature when cures don't materialize and diets don't turn out to be magical we lose confidence in science and start to think of all science communication as misleading then there's the opposite effect if a simplification is too engaging if the story it tells is too good it can distort the true complexity of a subject and give you a full sense of security and an illusion of deep knowledge a gut feeling that you understand the science better than you actually do will which can lead people to ignore actual experts over their dangerous superficial knowledge and gut feeling and this can have negative consequences for all of us because in the worst case overconfidence in your own understanding of science can lead to bad decisions made with confidence just think of the surch of people that confidently disavow vaccines or climate change without truly understanding the subject matter so considering all of this and the fact that we at kots gazar reach Millions of people with our videos how do we handle this well it has been a journey especially the research when we started we just read articles then moved on to books peer reviewed papers then to conversations with experts we began to collect our sources with every step we realized that we were still not doing enough nowadays we try to read as many primary sources as possible talk to multiple experts and document our simplifications and give further reading in our sources dog but doesn't make our process Flawless what do you do if experts disagree with each other what do you do if you find an amazing fact that perfectly fits a narrative but just can't find its primary source how do you deal with the reality that many scientific results have huge error bars or mayis attached to them how do you handle complex systems that defy easy answers in the end we make 10-minute videos so we need to make decisions about what details and explanations can fit which aspects need to be simplified and which parts to cut there is no single best answer for how to do this and so we weigh the different options every single time it can be painful for experts to see their fields simplified some are happy with us while others don't like it this is fair but also impossible to avoid we're still trying to improve and want to be transparent about what we're trying to do for example we're taking part in the tresa project about science communication to learn more all of this brings us to the purpose of our videos the most important thing we want to do with this channel is to inspire you and Spark your curiosity for Science and the amazing Universe we live in learning often doesn't feel like fun but with the right story it is one of the best things and we hope to provide that to you ultimately we hope that we light a fire in you that motivates you to read books pay more attention at school or university and just get interested in a scientific field or two and learn more on your own not because you have to but because you want to know more about how the world really works because the universe is beautiful and science is a way of seeing this beauty more clearly and we hope that knowing that we have to simplify a bit does not make you enjoy our videos less we are trying to build something with kot kazak and while we're not 100% sure yet what exactly hopefully something that gets people to think about their own life and the context they exist in today as well as the far future and the potential we all have as a species and of course how big things are and what happens when we blow stuff up because it's fun thanks for watching and sharing and supporting us we really can't do this without you\", \"food is arguably the best thing about being alive no other bodily pleasure is enjoyed multiple times every day and never gets old it's an expression of culture our parents love and a means of Celebration or Comfort that's why it hits a special nerve when we're told we should change what and how we eat to fight rapid climate change one of the most delicious foods meat gets the worst press it doesn't help that the topic is really hard to properly research yourself and that debates get emotional quickly but clearly science can give us an answer the reality is well it's complicated let's take a look at three climate arguments against meat that are used a lot and see what [Music] happens one does our diet really play that bigger role in climate change feeding billions of people is impossible without causing emissions even if someday we have zero carbon tractors refrigerators and cookers running on renewable energy and electric trucks to move our food there are still unavoidable emissions rice emits methane we cut down forests to make room for pastures and crops and we emit nitrous oxide when we use fertilizers and manure worldwide food production is responsible for about 26% of all human-made greenhouse gas emissions which is unfortunate since food is not optional while 26% doesn't sound that bad it means that even if we extinguished all other sources of emissions today the emissions from food alone would still use up our entire carbon budget by 2,100 so no matter how we twist and turn it food is a real driver of climate change still emissions from different food items vary a lot how do things look when we compare their Footprints separately food's climate impact is most often based on life cycle assessments an analysis that looks at all the emissions of a product throughout its existence from production to Transportation packaging use and waste management in the most detailed meta analysis of life cycle assessments to date beef emissions stand out at the top on average a kilogram of beef emits 71 kg of CO2 equivalent lamb is also high at 40 k pork emits 12 and poultry 10 kg at the bottom we have lots of plant-based Foods potatoes for example emit around 150 times less than beef the most important aspect of food isn't weight though it's nutrient density a kilogram of beef would keep you alive much longer than a kilogram of potatoes so how does the ranking change if we compare emissions per calorie or protein not much animal protein is still the most costly for the environment and beef and lamb are also outliers in emissions per calorie but is this Fair after all not all beef is the same there are all sorts of ways to rear cattle from Pure grass-fed to factory farming the worst beef comes in at 105 kg of emissions per 100 g of protein the best at only 9 a 10-fold difference in contrast most other Foods especially plant-based have a much narrower Spectrum still the best beef is worse than the worst plant okay but this seems promising can we buy the right beef and lower our emissions Maybe by buying locally produced beef to minimize our footprint two does buying local food actually matter let's stick with beef since it's such an outlier by buying locally you are trying to avoid emissions from transportation and packaging but it turns out these only account for 0.5 to 2% of beef's total emissions actually transport and packaging combined are only about 11% of all food emissions nearly all food transport emissions are produced over the last few miles the regional travel on the road supplying the markets and shops in your area International Food transport happens mostly on freight ships which are insanely efficient for example shipping 1 kg of avocados from South America to Europe generates about 0 0.3 kg of CO2 equivalent in transport emissions and around 2.5 kg overall while 1 kg of beef from your local butcher will come in at 18 kg in CO2 equivalence at least so even when shipped great distances emissions from almost all plant-based foods cause lower emissions than locally produced animal products okay so if transport doesn't play a big role what causes the vast amounts of emissions from beef then by far the largest share of beef emissions consists of methane released directly by The Animals while CO2 hangs around for centuries methane only stays in the atmosphere for decades but in these short periods it is very powerful all in all methane has already caused 23 to 40% of human-made warming so far there's controversy about how bad this is exactly and we don't want to Dive In Too Deep here but the way things stand any kind of extra emissions are not great still all cows burp and fart to similar degrees what explains the spectrum of beef emissions there are a couple of things it makes a difference if the beef comes from a dairy herd or one dedicated to beef production 44% of the world's beef comes from dairy cows sharing its footprint with dairy products dairy cows tend to get higher quality feed which makes them grow faster and emit less methane geography also plays a role because it determines which farming methods are possible the worst Factor by far is the destruction of forests for Farmland not only does this release the CO2 that was bound in the Flora it sets free Carbon that was stored in the soil and destroys its ability to store it in the future this aspect accounts for much of the range of emissions in beef the worst emitters are farms burning down rainforest for Farmland especially in Brazil there is a Sinister truth hidden here the more animals suffer the better they are in terms of climate change because they are way more efficient they use less land and their food is brought right to them and so they grow faster and don't expand energy on things like walking cattle in a factory farm that never get to roam pastures can sometimes be less destructive for the climate than cattle grazing peacefully on a formerly Lush piece of rainforest but isn't it a bit out of touch with reality to demonize cows so much some of the land these animals are grazing on isn't suitable for crops Anyway by grazing on pastures they can turn things we can't digest into food isn't farming animals just a smart way to make the best use of unused resources three don't cows mainly use land that we can't use for agriculture or other things about half of the world's ice and desert free land is used for agriculture an area the size of the entire Americas plus China half of all agriculturally used land is dedicated to animals most of it is grassland 65% of which cannot be converted to cropland so pasturing animals is actually a very efficient way to use those areas since we can't grow human food there anyway there are a couple of catches here though while the idea of cows turning useless grass into steak is nice it is part of a marketing lie even though it is so massive pasture land alone can't support the ruminant living on it globally grazing systems sustain only 133% of beef production so if we were to switch to 100% grass-fed we'd simply have to eat much less beef in the US beef production would crash by some 70% if it were to exclusively rely on grass the only way to sustain our high demand for meat is by growing crops and feeding them to our cattle and we haven't even talked about chicken and pig which exclusively eat feed crops because of this feed demand less than half of the world's cereals are used directly as human food 41% is fed to animals the same is true for soy there's a lot of talk about Amazon deforestation for soy production which makes us think of soy milk and tofu but only 19% of global soy production goes towards products for humans about 77% is used to feed animals besides land without food crops isn't automatically ecologically useless a beefree diet would free up around 2 billion hectares a vegan diet would free up around 3 billion hectares of land we could use this land to grow forests or restore wild grasslands basically anything that could suck carbon out of the atmosphere if we sped 3 billion hectares of land it could remove about 8 billion tons of CO2 from the air per year by comparison we emit about 50 billion tons of CO2 equivalent per year at the moment that means we could save 16% of emissions by eating a vegan diet okay to summarize food is a huge driver of emissions meat but especially beef is the worst food in terms of emissions buying locally does not have a big impact on food emissions compared to the type of food you're consuming when it comes to Beef Cattle that are grass-fed can sometimes even be counterproductive because they just need much more land even if you find the most environmentally friendly beef in the world your burger still comes with a significantly higher carbon footprint than a veggie patty you can decide for yourself what you want to do with this information\", \"you're not a person you're a planet made of roughly 40 trillion cells there is so much of you that if your cells were humanized you'd be as big as 20 Mount Everest for your creepy cwy inhabitants this makes your body an ecosystem rich in resources and warmth and space a perfect place to move into and have a family while some of these guests are welcome most are not your immune system is the guardian of this planet the force tasked with protecting yourself against the constant danger of invasion unfortunately your enemies in the tiny world have a huge [Music] Advantage consider the effort it takes to make a single copy of yourself and your trillions of cells first you need to find someone who thinks you're cute date and be awkward and if things work out in a complicated dance two of your cells merge together then you need to wait for months while the cell multiplies over and over until it's released into the world as a human being and even then you only have a mini copy that needs years to become remotely useful a bacterium consists of one cell it can make a fully grown copy in about half an hour a virus can turn into 100 hundreds within hours and billions within days your enemies multiply orders of magnitude faster than you even worse for a bacterium or virus your body is a hostile ecosystem applying selective pressure because they go through so many generations so quickly eventually by pure chance there will be an individual that mutates and adapts in just the right way to resist your defenses and then multiply quickly again in other words you're facing a sheer endless variety of different enemies and you're too slow to keep up with their evolution this is bad luckily your immune system is just about the most amazing thing ever the second most complex biological system known to us after the human brain and so sophisticated that we still haven't discovered all its Secrets since it's so complicated we have to simplify and focus on one thing at a time if you want the full story wait for the announcement at the end of the video okay so why are we not all killed by some new bacteria or virus in a nutshell you actually have two immune systems the innate and the Adaptive immune system the innate immune system was ready when you were born it mostly consists of general purpose soldiers we introduced them in the last immune video the Adaptive immune system carries two types of cells t- cells and B cells that are your super weapons and are are incredibly effective and deadly for your enemies these cells are complicated to produce and take a lot of time to deploy but once they're ready they pack a real punch what makes your adaptive immune system so powerful is that it has the largest library in the universe it has an answer to everything you have at least one of these super weapon cells inside you to fight the black death the Corona virus and the first deadly bacteria that will emerge in a city on Mars in 100 years this makes it possible for you to counter the ability of bacteria and viruses to change so rapidly how is this possible to understand what's going on here we need to take one step back all organisms on Earth are made from the same basic parts mostly proteins proteins are the building blocks of life and can have billions of different shapes you can imagine them as 3D puzzle pieces there are billions of different puzzle pieces your enemies can use to construct their bodies why is this important because proteins are in a way the language of the microw world cells don't have eyes or ears so to tell friend from foe they have to touch them and recognize if their protein is part of a friend or part of an enemy recognizing means that cells have countless tiny devices called receptors that are able to connect with a specific protein puzzle piece so your cells have tiny puzzle pieces on on their outsides that are able to click together or recognize other protein puzzle pieces when a cell connects together with a protein and recognizes it as enemy it knows that it has to attack only if your cells can make this distinction between Friend or Foe is your immune system able to fight an Invader but since there are billions of possible protein puzzle pieces this means there are billions of possible enemy puzzle pieces this is also one of the reasons we still have to deal with diseases like the flu each year the influenza virus mutates very rapidly and so the proteins that make up its Hull constantly change a tiny bit the soldiers of your innate immune system have a large number of the puzzle pieces for common bacteria and viruses memorized that's why they are your allpurpose weapons but they are ineffective against many billions of mutations and adaptations that your enemies can develop so the reason you are still alive is that your adaptive immune system is able to recognize between 1 billion and 10 billion different enemy protein puzzle pieces which is enough to be prepared for every possible enemy but how is this possible how could your immune system possibly have this much of a variety to be prepared for every possible protein puzzle piece well the cells of your adaptive immune system found a cheat coat mixing and matching their own genetic code to create this stunning variety of receptors the details are way too complicated for this video but in a nutshell your adaptive immune cells have official permission to take a tiny part of their own genetic code and mix it in random ways to create billions of different receptors a good way to explain this is by asking you to imagine an army of cooks with each of them wanting their own special recipe they have 100 different ingredients to choose from each ingredient stands for one tiny piece of genetic code in this metaphor so each cook takes a few random ingredients and randomly mixes them together maybe tomato chicken rice and half an onion as entree marshmallow pepper strawberries and a quter banana as a dessert or cucumber beef potatoes and two carrots and blueberries chocolate and cream with a pinch of cinnamon even with slight variation and with only 100 ingredients there are billions of possible recipes and likewise with just a small selection of Jean fragments your cells create billions of re CHS the details of this are so cool that they should get their own video or their own chapter in a book in any case by mixing up Gene fragments you get up to 10 billion different combinations so in the end you get billions of immune cells and each of them has one specific and unique receptor the dish from our metaphor that is able to recognize one specific protein puzzle piece in total you end up with at least one cell for every enemy that could possibly exist but here we run into a pretty dangerous problem if your adaptive immune system is making weapons that can attack every possible protein puzzle piece in the universe wouldn't it also make some that can attack your own cells yes it happens all the time this is so fundamentally dangerous to your survival that you have a whole organ that does nothing but work on preventing this the murder University of your thymus your thymus is a chicken wing sized organ above your heart and you've probably never heard of it interestingly your thymus is one of the reasons why your immune system weakens as you age because it's in a constant state of decline once you reach puberty but what does the thymus do in your murder University your immune system is putting your adaptive immune cells through an intense and deadly curriculum basically it's showing them all sorts of protein puzzle pieces that are used by your own cells to see how they react when a young cell recogniz izes a body puzzle piece and wants to attack it the teacher cells order them to kill themselves and they are eaten up and recycled the immune system is so particular about this process that around 98% of your adaptive immune cells that enter murder University die there 2% graduate and get to do their job of protecting you for real if this process goes wrong and cells Escape that can recognize your own protein puzzle pieces this can lead to autoimmune disease where your immune system attacks your own body from the inside and this again is another story for another time okay let's summarize your immune system has two parts one that defends you right after birth and one that carries the largest library of super weapons in the universe but needs to boot up first to create billions of different super weapons your adaptive immune cells recombine a part of their genetic code to create a breathtaking variety of attack weapons then they enter a murder University that only 2% survive to make sure they don't attack you and then you end up with billions of different cells that in total are able to protect you against every possible enemy in the universe now wait a second if this is all true why do we get sick at all why was a new disease like covid-19 able to kill millions of people well everything we've just learned about is a tiny tiny window into the amazing struggle for life and death that plays out every day inside your body and there are so many amazing details and questions here how does your body actually find the right cell in time to protect you how do your enemies fight back and overcome your immune system anyway and what about all the things that didn't fit in this video well today finally marks the release of immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by Philip Detmer the founder and headwriter of kts AR first we had to push the release back because of cargo trouble and then because so many of you pre-ordered that we didn't have enough copies for the original launch day thank you so so much for that immune tells the Epic story of your immune system and will forever change how you think about your own body how you experience being sick and healthy the book is written to be as fun and easy to grasp as Kazar videos but is able to dive way deeper into its subject so go on a journey through the hidden microverse within yourself witness deadly Wars between billions of Invaders and cells learn how your immune system actually works and protects you from Cuts cancer and covid never before have we so urgently needed to learn about how immunity Works immune is fun and great to look at and it even smells good follow the link in the description to order it today this is the end of a decade long personal Journey working on this so thank you all so so much for your support and thank thank you for watching and

An estimated four billion species emerged\\non our planet in past eons. But at least 99% of them died out, way before\\nhumans spoke the first words. The vast majority of all the different species\\nthat ever existed are so utterly deleted that they have become part of the “unknown unknown”\\npart of the past, lost to us forever. Or are they? Could we use science and imagination to glimpse\\na shadow of the unreachable past? Let us start with what we DO know. To learn about creatures of the past we need\\nfossils, any sort of remains preserved from past geological ages – bones or shells,\\nimpressions or imprints, things preserved in amber. The totality of all fossils on earth is called\\nthe fossil record and it is the most important window on the past we’ll ever have. For a dead animal to fossilize a number of\\nthings must go just right: The right environment, timing and conditions. And then the fossil needs to survive for millions\\nor hundreds of millions of years and then get back to the surface – and then be discovered\\nbefore natural processes dissolve it. So it is kind of a miracle that we have what\\nwe have and know what we know. Take the dinosaurs since they were one of\\nthe largest and most successful groups of animals for some 165 million years – and\\nare also a lot of fun to animate. What were they really like and what are we\\nmissing? In the last 200 years we’ve found tens of\\nthousands of fossils from over 1000 dinosaur species.. Lately we’ve entered a golden era of discovery\\nand about 50 new dinosaur species are discovered each year, expanding what we know and what\\nwe know that we don’t know about them, which is amazing. But it also makes us aware of all the things\\nlost to the past forever. Imagine if we took all the animals that lived\\nin the last 50 million years and randomly chose 10000 individuals from 1000 species\\nto fossilize. Think about all the things that would be missed,\\nor that seem too weird to be true. Like the Giraffe, a yellow animal with brown\\npatterns that looks like a horse and an antelope had a baby, with a long neck and two tiny\\nhairy horns. How many “dinosaur giraffes” were there? Animals so weird and selected for ecological\\nniches so specific that evolution molded their bodies very absurdly - today they might seem\\nmade up to us.. We know a lot of species are lost forever\\njust because of the environment they lived in. For example, lush jungles basically prevent\\nfossilization as the chances that an animal will be buried here is minimal. Countless scavengers of all sizes break down\\nfreshly deceased animals extremely quickly and the soil is often so acidic that bones\\nare dissolved. And so fossils of dinosaurs from jungles are\\npractically nonexistent. Today half of all known species live in the\\nfew remaining rainforests that only cover 2% of earth's landmass. Millions of years ago when dinosaurs roamed\\nearth, jungles covered much more of the planet. So besides some insects and other small animals\\ntrapped in amber, there should be millions of species that emerged and vanished, without\\nleaving any trace. Trapped deep inside the unknown, unknown. But just in general biology trips us up. Look at your body. It’s mainly squishy, gooey, soft stuff. Which does not preserve well. What remains the longest are the crystalized\\nparts of your bones and so most dinosaur fossils are bones or teeth – usually fragments,\\nnot entire skeletons. This means that almost all boneless or shell-less\\nanimals are practically wiped from the fossil record. If we take a look at the stunning diversity\\nof weird animals like worms, jellyfish and slugs alive today we can only speculate what\\nwe are missing. Although thankfully many mostly soft and gooey\\nspecies also left us an incredible diversity of shells that tell us an amazing amount about\\nour past, so at least we have that. Still when we think about all the boneless\\nspecies that may have existed in the last half billion years even our best attempt at\\nimagining them falls short. But it's not like reimagining something based\\non its bones is straightforward and so the way we envisage what dinosaurs actually looked\\nlike has changed a lot in the last few years. In the past many illustrations had a bony,\\nminimalistic look, with a toothy grin to signify fierceness and danger. But if we draw today's animals in a similar\\nway, based on their skeletons, just for the fun of it, we get the most bizarre creatures. Elephants, swans and baboons that look like\\nmonsters right out of nightmares. So similar to animals today, we should imagine\\ndinosaurs with much more soft tissue, fat bellies or chests, weird soft parts like skin\\nflaps, lips and gums and just more pronounced features that would make them seem like much\\nmore pleasant fellows. Some soft features actually leave distinctive\\ntraces on bones that we can look for in the skeletons of extinct animals, which is where\\ntoday’s animals with similar features are really helpful. It’s a similar story with color. Because we know what the feathers of living\\nbirds look like, modern technology combined with the exceedingly rare fossils with preserved\\nremains of fuzzy feathers give us a glimpse of the real colors of extinct dinosaurs. We know that tiny Sinosauropteryx had a striped\\ntail and its tiny dino buddy Anchiornis huxleyi was white and black with gorgeous red feathers\\naround its head. Still, for the vast majority of really any\\nancient extinct species we have no real clue what color they were. But we know what modern dinosaurs, birds,\\nlook like and here we find the most amazing variety. So some dinosaurs will have tried to blend\\ninto the background, while others might have fielded aggressive color schemes to attract\\nmates or to appear dangerous. Some might have had impressive decorations\\nor colorful beaks. Some may have been striped or patterned. Similarly we don’t know that much about\\ndinosaur behaviour, although once again we can draw conclusions from existing animals. For example even apex predators like lions\\nspend a lot of their time lying around and cuddling and licking each other and playing. Why would dinosaurs be so different? When we first found the skull of T. rex with\\nits mighty teeth and probably the strongest bite of any land animal ever, we imagined\\na fierce and stupid beast. But modern scanning technology has revealed\\nthat T.rex had a larger brain-to-body ratio than some earlier giant meat-eaters. And it probably had very sharp hearing, vision\\nand sense of smell and was in all likelihood not a stupid animal. So maybe T.rex was a cuddly fellow that spent\\na lot of time playing around or impressing potential mates when it was not hungry. Likewise, while their horns and shields might\\nhave made ceratopsids appear to be natural born fighters, they were probably much more\\nthan that. Based on the behaviour of modern animals and\\nthe complex dances some have to go through to mate, maybe their shields were amazingly\\ncolorful, maybe it danced for its mates like many birds do today. How intensely amazing these creatures must\\nhave been. And what a loss it is to us that we don’t\\nget to experience them first hand. What an even greater loss that there is so\\nmuch we will never know about them and even more tragic, all the absurd and beautiful\\nbeings that disappeared without a trace. But such is life – time marches on without\\nany concern for our feelings and the past expands with every moment that passes. Most wild animals alive today will in all\\nlikelihood not leave fossils behind and also just disappear forever. We can do something about that though – instead\\nof accelerating the extinction we are witnessing we could become the guardians of life and\\npreserve it where we find it. If possible in the wild, if not then in museums,\\nmovies and in our minds. Because as amazing as our imagination is,\\nand as fascinating to think about the animals that are part of the unknown unknown – it\\nis even better to witness them in the present.\", \"The past is a vast and mysterious land that\\nbegins at the big bang and ends in the present, expanding with each passing moment. It is the home of everything that came before,\\nthe key to understanding our present. Here we find the most amazing creatures to\\never roam our planet, hundreds of millions of species so diverse that our imagination\\ncannot do them justice. Unfortunately the past carefully guards its\\nsecrets. While there are a lot of things about the\\npast we know, there are way more things we know we don’t know.

everybody today we're doing something different an exclusive preview we'll listen to the introduction and a chapter from the ktz gazar book immune a journey into the mysterious system that keeps you alive written by ktz gazar founder and headwriter Philip debar it's about the Epic story of the immune system the most important thing you don't know enough about and will forever change how you think about your body immune will be released on November the 2nd and you can pre-order it right now links in the description so now get comfy for a rare Audio Only experience introduction imagine waking up tomorrow feeling a bit under the weather an annoying pain in your throat your nose is runny you cough a bit all in all not bad enough to skip work you think as you step into the shower pretty annoyed about how hard your life is while you are totally not being a whiny little baby your immune system is not complaining it is busy keeping you alive so you can live to Wine another day and so while Intruders roam your body killing hundreds of thousands of your cells your immune system is organizing complex defenses communicating over vast distances activating intricate defense networks and dishing out a swift death to Millions if not billions of enemies all while you are standing in the shower mildly annoyed but this complexity is largely hidden which is a real shame because there are not many things that have such a crucial impact on the quality of your life as your immune system it is all embracing and all-encompassing protecting you from bothersome nuisances like the common cold scratches and cuts to life-threatening stuff from cancer and pneumonia to deadly infections like covid-19 your immune system is as indispensable as your heart or your lungs and actually it is one of the largest and most widespread organ systems throughout your body although we don't tend to think about it in these terms for most of us the immune system is a vague and cloud-like entity that follows strange and untransparent rules and which seems to sometimes work and sometimes not it is a bit like the weather extremely hard to predict and subject to endless speculation and opinions resulting in actions that feel random to us unfortunately many people speak about the immune system with confidence but without actually understanding it it can be hard to know which information to trust and why but what even is the immune system and how does it actually work understanding the mechanisms that are keeping you alive as you read this is not just a nice exercise in intellectual curiosity it is desperate needed knowledge if you know how the immune system works you can understand and appreciate vaccines and how they can save your life or the lives of your children and approach disease and sickness with a very different mindset and far less fear you become less suceptible to snake Hall salesmen who offer Wonder drugs that are entirely devoid of logic you get a better grasp on the kinds of medication that might actually help you when you are sick you get to know what you can do to boost your immune Sy system you can protect your kids from dangerous microbes while also not being too stressed out if they get dirty playing outside and in the very unlikely case of say a global pandemic knowing what a virus does to you and how your body fights it might help you understand what the public health experts say besides all these practical and useful things the immune system is also Simply Beautiful a Wonder of nature like no other the immune system is not a mere tool to make your cough go away it is inextricably tied into almost all other processes in your body and while it is centrally important to keeping you alive it is likely that it may also be the part of your body that causes your untimely death either by failing or by being too active I have been fascinated and obsessed by the incredible complexity of the human immune system for the better part of a decade now it began in University with where I was studying information design and was looking for a semester project and the immune system seemed like a good idea so I got a large pile of books about immunology and began digging in but no matter how much I read things just did not get less complicated the more I learned the more impossible it seemed to simplify the immune system as every layer revealed more mechanisms more exceptions more complexity and so a project that was supposed to last the spring took the summer and then the fall and the winter the interactions of the parts of the immune system were too elegant and the dance they danced was too beautiful to stop learning about them this progress fundamentally changed how I experienced and felt about my body when I got the flu I could no longer just complain but had to look at my body touch my swollen lymph nodes and visualize what my immune cells were doing right then which part of the network was Act at and how te- cells killed millions of intruders to protect me when I cut myself while being careless in the forest I felt gratitude for my macras large immune cells hunting scared bacteria and ripping them into pieces to protect the open wound from infection after taking a bite of the wrong granola bar and suffering an allergic shock while being rushed to the hospital I thought about M cells and IG antibodies and how they had almost killed me in a misguided attempt to to protect me from scary food stuffs when I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 32 and had to undergo a couple of operations and then chemotherapy my obsession with Immunology became even more intense one of the jobs of my immune system is to kill cancer in this case it had failed but I somehow could not be angry or too upset as I had learned how hard of a job this was for my immune cells and how hard cancer had to work to keep them in check and as the chemo melted the cancer my thoughts again went to my immune cells invading the dying tumors and eating them up one cell after another disease and sickness are scary and unsettling and I've had plenty of that in my life but knowing how my cells my immune system this integral and personal part of myself defended The Entity that is me how it fought and died and healed and restored this body I inhabit always gave me a lot of comfort learning about the immune system made my life better and more interesting and it alleviated a lot of the anxiety that comes with being sick knowing about the immune system always put things in perspective so because of this positive effect and just because of the fun of learning and reading about the immune system it became an ongoing hobby as I eventually became a science communicator and explaining complex things became my purpose in life about 8 years ago I started CTS kazak in a nutshell a YouTube channel dedicated to making information easy to understand and beautiful while trying to be as true to the science as possible in early 2021 the ktz kazak team has grown to over 40 people working on this Vision while the channel has attracted over 14 million subscribers and reaches about 30 million viewers each month so if this large platform exists why go through the horrible process of writing this book well while some of our most successful videos have been about the immune system it has always bugged me that I could not explore this wonderful Topic in the depth it deserves a 10-minute video is simply not the right medium for that so this book is a way to turn my decade long love affair with the immune system into something tangible that will hopefully be a helpful and entertaining way to learn about the stunning and beautiful complexity that makes it possible for you to survive each day unfortunately the immune system is very complicated although that is not strong enough a word the immune system is complicated in the sense that climbing Mount Everest is a nice stroll through nature it is intuitive like reading the Chinese translation of the tax code of Germany is a fun Sunday afternoon the immune system is the most complex biological system known to humanity other than the human brain the bigger the Immunology textbook you read the more layers of detail start piling on the more exceptions to rules appear the more intricate the system becomes the more specific it seems to be for every possible eventuality every single one of its many parts has multiple jobs and functions and areas of expertise that overlap and influence each other even if you make it past these challenges and still want to understand the immune system you will encounter another problem the humans who described it scientists have laid the foundation for the amazing modern world we get to enjoy today through hard work and endless curiosity and we owe them a great deal of gratitude unfortunately though many scientists are really bad at choosing good names and coming up with accessible language for the things they discover the science of Immunology is one of the worst culprits of any scientific discipline in this regard an already breathtakingly complex field is spiked with words like major hisst compatibility complex class 1 and 2 Gamma Delta T cells interfere on Alpha Beta gamma and Kappa and the complement system with actors named C4 B2 a3b complex none of this makes it a pleasure to pick up a textbook and learn about the immune system on your own but even without this barrier the complex relationships of the many different actors of the immune system with countless exceptions and unintuitive rules are a challenge all by themselves Immunology is hard even for the people working in public health even for the people studying Immunology even for the foremost experts in the field all of this makes the immune system horrible to explain if you venture too far into simplification you deprive the learner of the beauty and wonder that lie in The evolutionary Genius of the sheer endless complexity that deals with the most crucial problems of living beings but if you include too much detail it quickly becomes mind-numbingly hard to keep up with listing everything every part of the immune system is just too much it would be like telling someone your whole life story on the first date overwhelming and very likely to make them less interested in dating you so my aim for this book is to try to carefully dance around all these problems it will use human language and use complicated words only when necessary where appropriate processes and and interactions will be simplified while staying as true to the science as possible complexity between chapters will go up and down so after you are fed a lot of information there will be more chill parts to relax a bit and we will summarize what we learned in regular intervals I want this book to make it possible for everybody to understand their own immune system and have a bit of fun doing so and since this complexity and Beauty are deeply connected to your health and survival you might actually learn something useful and of course the next time you are sick or have to deal with disease you hopefully can look at your body from a different perspective also the obligatory disclaimer I'm not an immunologist but a science communicator and immune system Enthusiast this book will not make every immunologist happy what became obvious right from the start of the research is that there are a lot of different ideas and Concepts about the details of the immune system and and there is a lot of disagreement between the scientists holding these ideas which is how science is supposed to work for example some immunologists consider certain cells useless fossils While others think they are crucial for your defenses so as much as possible this book is based on conversations with Scientists the current literature that is used to teach immunology and peer-reviewed papers still at some point in the future parts of this book will need an update which is a good thing the science of Immunology is a dynamic field where a lot of amazing things are happening and different theories and ideas are in flux with each other the immune system is a living topic where great discoveries are still happening which is great because it means we are learning more about ourselves and the world we live in okay before we jump in and explore what your immune system is doing let us Define the premise first so we have Solid Ground to stand on what is the immune system what is the context it works in and what are the tiny parts that do the actual work after we have covered these Basics we will explore what happens if you hurt yourself and how your immune system rushes in to defend you then we'll explore your most vulnerable parts and see how your body scrambles to protect from a serious infection and lastly we'll take a look at different immune disorders like allergies and autoimmune disease and discuss how you can boost your immune system but now let us get to the very beginning of this story two what is there to defend before we can really learn about your intricate defense system we should take a look at what needs to be defended your body in a sense this seems pretty straightforward it is the entire area under and including your skin simple enough right but just like looking at a planet in space you will never see anything remotely approaching the full picture from orbit so before we do anything else first we need to go on a journey together into a strange and foreign World Stranger Than the deep sea or an alien planet a world where no living being therein even knows that it exists where monsters are a daily reality but nobody cares a world billions of years old that exists within yourself within everybody and everything all around us omnipresent but invisible this is the world of the tiny where the border between dead and alive becomes fuzzy where biochemistry becomes life for reasons we still do not understand let us zoom into you and take a look into your organs through the tissue to our most fundamental building blocks your cells cells are extremely tiny living things among the smallest units of life on Earth for a single cell your body is a planet drifting through a hostile Universe to understand the enormous dimensions of your body we need to look at it from a cell's perspective at the scale of a cell your body is an utterly gigantic structure of pipes as wide as mountains filled with oceans of fluids rapid torren permeating intricate cave systems stretching as far as whole countries with the exception of the crystallized hard parts of your bones all of the environment all of the world really is to a cell alive a cell can politely ask a wall to let it pass and then squeeze through a tiny Gap that closes behind it it can swim through channels and hi up mountains of meat to get anywhere it needs to go if you were the size of one of your cells the body of a human would be in the area of 15 to 20 mount everestsolar it would be a mountain of Flesh at least 60 M 100 km tall reaching into space if you are near a window take a second and look into the sky try to imagine this for a moment a giant so large that passenger planes would crash against its lower legs its head so far above you that you would not be able to see it the cells of your immune system are tasked to defend all of that especially the weak points where Intruders can enter it which is mostly the borders the outsides of the body when you think about your outsides the first thing that comes to mind is of course your skin the total surface area of your skin is about 2 square yards M about half the size of a pool table and luckily is not that hard to defend since most of it is made out of a hard and thick barrier covered with its own defense system it feels soft but it is pretty hard to breach if it is intact your real weak points to infections are your mucous membranes the surface that lines your windpipe and lungs eyelids mouth and nose your stomach and intestines your reproductive tracts and bladder it is hard to give their total surface area since numbers vary so much from person to person but on average there are about 200 square yards meters of mucous membranes in a healthy adult about the same as a tennis court most of them being your lungs and your digestive tract you may mistakenly think of your mucous membranes as your inside but this is not true your mucous membranes are outside if we took an honest look at what you are you are in a sense nothing more than a complex tube granted a tube that can close both ends also a lot wetter slimier and grosser your reproductive organs nostrils and ears are extra holes entrances to large tunnels and additional cave systems that reach through you all of these places are your direct borders contact points with the outside world your body is just wrapped around them these outsides within your insides represent surfaces where millions of intruders are trying to enter you every day a lot of ground to defend when you are the size of a cell for your cells the surface area of the mucus membranes is is as big as Central Europe or the central United States are to you building border walls would not do the trick for them since they don't need to defend just the borders but the entire surface it's not like intruders are trying to enter just at the edges they could sort of drop in with parachutes so your cells need to defend the entire continent all of it still it's much easier to catch an enemy at one of these points than somewhere else for examp example if we took all the blood vessels and capillaries from your body and laid them out in a straight line they would be a baffling 74,000 M 120,000 km long three times the circumference of Earth with about 1,400 square yards 1,200 M of surface area so better catch enemies at the borders that are significantly smaller and therefore easier to defend but easier does not mean easy let's do a fun experiment and imagine that we wanted to build a human body to scale but from actual people like Q living breathing humans just to see what sort of crazy Dimensions we encounter here so first we need a lot of people for that the average human body is made from around 40 trillion cells trillion 40 trillion is 40000000000 0000 a truly impressive number if we want yourselves to be represented by individual people then we need more than 100 times as many people as have lived in the 250,000 yearlong history of humanity let's try to visualize this a bit right now around 7.8 billion people are alive if we put them shoulder-to-shoulder they surprisingly would only cover an area of around 700 100 square mil 1,800 km which is a little bit more than the surface area of London to get 40 trillion people we need to multiply this by 120 and this is only half of the story because your body hosts bacteria that you need to survive how many one bacterium for each of the 40 trillion cells in your body which happens to be a pretty good ballpark in terms of size if you were the size of an average body cell a bacterium would be roughly the size of a bunny let us imagine them as baby bunnies to make the thought less horrifying most of these cute bunnies live in your gut in this ginormous cave 36 trillion bunnies live their lives constantly dying and reproducing breaking down chunks of food the size of skyscrapers so it can be distributed to all the people making up the continent to flesh the other four trillion bunnies are crawling on your skin are inside your lungs hopping over your teeth your tongue they swim in the fluid of your eyes crawl in and out of your ears we'll talk more about them later but for now just imagine yourself is being covered by cute bunnies who are your friends and have only your best interests in mind okay so we now have 40 trillion people standing shoulder Tosh shoulder this ocean of people would cover the whole of the United Kingdom every last Corner Lake and Mountain to make a body to scale made of people represent presenting cells we need to stack them until trillions of people are standing on top of each other holding hands and linking arms forming living structures a giant made out of Flesh Rises 60 M 100 km into the sky reaching the edge of space the giant is made up of caverns as wide as small countries bones as dense and wide as mountains filled with intricate caves and tunnels its arteries are filled with oceans of fluid and people carrying food and oxygen tanks to every last Corner if you were a red blood cell or in this case red blood person you would travel the distance from Paris to Rome and back once a minute in a stream pumped by a heart as large as a city things could be great everybody would work together to keep the mountain of Flesh and in consequence themselves alive but the enormous richness of resources and food and the abundance of warm space is just too attractive the giant is not only the size of a continent for its inhabitants but also for unwelcome visitors literally billions of parasites are trying to get inside the flesh giant some are as large as Elephants or blue whales and they want to lay giant eggs so their young can Feast on the poor people that make up the tissues others are the size of raccoons or rats who want to steal the food and make the giant their permanent home home to raise generations of their offspring they may not intend to harm the people making up the body but they will do so by defecating everywhere making life miserable the most disgusting Vermin our flesh giant has to deal with daily are billions of spiders who want to enter the cell people's mouths or ears to breed in the stomachs of their victims for a giant made up of trillions of people losing a few here and there is not really dangerous but if the Vermin were allowed to create freely it could be its end isn't the idea horrifying this is what your sales deal with every single day and night from your birth until the day you die Staying Alive is not a thing you should take for granted but don't let this idea of being attacked distress you too much you are not just a mountain of Flesh waiting to be conquered thankfully you have a great Ally in this fight for survival that as we now know we simply don't cherish and celebrate as much as it deserves your immune system it makes you a fortress and even more a fortress filled with billions of the most effective and fierce soldiers in the universe they have countless weapons at their disposal and they use them without mercy your immune system Army has already killed billions of enemies and parasites in your life and it is ready to kill billions or trillions more

And yet we feel overwhelmed in the face of\\nrapid climate change. It seems simple on the surface. Greenhouse gases trap energy from the Sun\\nand transfer it to our atmosphere. This leads to warmer winters, harsher summers. Dry places become drier and wet places wetter. Countless ecosystems will die while the rising\\noceans swallow coasts and the cities we build on them. So why don’t we just like… prevent all\\nof that? Well, it’s complicated. The public debate about stopping rapid climate\\nchange often focuses on a few key features, like coal plants, cars or burping cows. And so the solutions are often simplistic\\n– rows of solar panels, biking to work, something something sustainability. And a huge talking point is personal responsibility. How YOU should change your lifestyle to prevent\\nrapid climate change, which we will find out together in the next few minutes. This is one of those videos where we want\\nto encourage you to watch to the end, because to discuss real doable solutions, we first\\nneed to understand  the problem. A Fuller Picture Modern industrial society as we constructed\\nit in the last 150 years, is inherently destructive to the planet. Basically everything we do to make our lives\\neasier, safer and more comfortable is making things worse for the biosphere. The food we eat, the streets we walk on, the\\nclothes we wear, the gadgets we use, the way we move around and the pleasant temperatures\\nwe artificially create around us. While most people know about the serious impact\\nof energy, beef, cars and planes, many major polluters are barely ever talked about. The emissions leaking out of landfills are\\nas significant as the emissions of all the jets in the air. More CO2 is released to run our homes than\\nfrom all cars combined. And the emissions produced when making a new\\ncar is equivalent to building just two metres of road. So it is nice to switch to electric cars but\\nthey won’t solve anything if we keep building roads the same way. Fixing one small part of the industrial system\\nis not enough. Each of the many different parts needs its\\nown solution and many of them aren’t straight forward. But even where we know what to do, just because\\na solution exists doesn’t mean we are able or willing to implement it. There are many gray areas in the fight against\\nrapid climate change, the most prominent one is the divide between rich and poor. Emissions vs poverty There is a clear connection between the prosperity\\nof a nation and its carbon emissions. In other words, richer people tend to cause\\nmore emissions. So the key to fixing climate change is simply\\nfor the world’s richest to cut back on their extravagant lifestyles right? While this would help, it wouldn’t make\\nthe problem go away. This is because 63% of global emissions come\\nfrom low to middle income countries. Countries where most people are not living\\nextravagantly but are trying to escape poverty at worst, and achieve a comfortable lifestyle\\nat best. The unfortunate reality is that, currently,\\nescaping poverty and becoming middle class creates unavoidable emissions. So asking developing countries to cut emissions\\njust looks like an attempt to keep them down. It is very hard to argue that a region should\\nprotect their primeval forests and spend money on solar panels instead of burning wood, when\\nit can’t meet basic needs for significant parts of its population. So, cutting back is not a popular demand,\\nespecially if the countries making these demands got rich by causing environmental damage in\\nthe past. For billions of people, more emissions are\\na good thing personally. When we forget about this, we tend to propose\\nunworkable solutions. Take concrete. 8% of CO2 emissions are released by the concrete\\nmanufacturing industry. Ok cool, stop using concrete, right? But right now, concrete is also a cheap and\\neasy way for growing populations in developing countries to build affordable housing. And there are many examples like that. Even rich countries aren’t immune from disagreeing\\nabout rapid climate change solutions. Banning coal, gas and oil from the energy\\nmix is slowed down by heated discussions about what should replace them. Citizens can be strictly against nuclear power\\nbut also oppose wind or solar infrastructure in their backyards. In principle all of these issues can be overcome\\n– but there are things we don’t currently know how to overcome. The most problematic one is food. Emit or Die We will soon need to feed 10 billion people,\\nand we don’t know how to do that without emitting greenhouse gases. Because of the nature of modern food production\\nthat requires fertilizers or manure, it is impossible to have zero-emissions food. Rice alone emits so much methane each year\\nthat it practically equals the emissions of all the air traffic in the world. What’s worse is that the foods we like the\\nmost emit the most. 57% of food emissions come from animal-based\\nfoods, although they make up only 18% of the world’s calories, and 37% of its protein. And as people across the world grow richer,\\nthey want more meat. Traditional diets in most cultures were primarily\\nplant based with a little meat on top. But with the rise of industrial style meat\\nproduction and factory farming, meat has become a staple food; a regular indulgence in developed\\ncountries and a symbol of status and wealth in developing countries. Today about 40 percent of the world’s habitable\\nland is used for meat production in some form or another, the size of North and South America\\ncombined. This is land on which we could otherwise allow\\nnative ecosystems to regrow, like forests in the Amazon, and suck carbon out of the\\natmosphere, but instead most of it is used to feed animals. The available solutions are uniquely able\\nto make everybody on the political spectrum, rich or poor, unhappy. Meat is highly emotional and there are a lot\\nof whataboutism arguments floating around, like comparing it to the worst sources of\\nemissions. In the end it is pretty simple: eating less\\nmeat alone won’t stop climate change, but we also can’t stop climate change without\\neating less meat. The same holds true for other things that\\nare less crucial to our survival but frankly not realistic to make go away. Like air travel, oversea shipping, mining\\nand the production of devices that play youtube videos. So what does this mean? Do we need to give up our way of life and\\ncan the poor never achieve it? Can’t some technology save us so we can\\ncontinue to drive our big cars and eat meat every day? Solutions vs Expenses In principle, this technology already exists:\\nDirect Air Capture of CO2 draws carbon dioxide from the air so that it can be stored underground\\nor transformed into products. So why aren’t we implementing it in every\\nindustry, everywhere? Because with the technology we have right\\nnow, this would cost some ten trillion dollars per year, or half the United States’ GDP. This money has to come from somewhere and\\ncurrently no-one is offering it. Just dumping these costs on massive polluters\\nlike steel mills and coal power stations would double the cost of their products – and\\nso these industries that operate on very tight profit margins would go bankrupt. Getting the government to pay for it seems\\nlogical but a lot of state resources are actually tied up doing the opposite, like subsidizing\\noil and gas. Which seems counter intuitive but follows\\nclear incentives. By artificially keeping fuel prices low, shipping\\nand everyday goods are kept artificially cheap too. Which has a major social impact on billions\\nof people around the world. That creates political lobbies and incentives\\nthat perpetuate this cycle that makes it so hard to cut off fossil fuel production. Meanwhile, very costly solutions for a far-off\\nproblem like carbon capture seem like they can wait, as technically nobody benefits from\\nit right now. Some argue that a move away from capitalism\\nis the only solution to this mess, others insist that markets should be even freer,\\nwithout any interventions like subsidies and some suggest that we need what’s referred\\nto as “degrowth” and to cut back as a species overall. But the truth is at least as of now, no political\\nsystem is doing an impressive job at becoming truly sustainable and none have really done\\nso in the past. We also don’t have the time to figure this\\nout and do a lot of experiments. We must implement solutions now. Not just to halt the release of all possible\\ngreenhouse gases, but also to start reducing the amount of CO2 in the air. It’s too late to just mend our ways, we\\nhave to actively correct our past mistakes. With every year we waste, more extreme changes\\nwill be unavoidable. Ok. Let’s take a deep breath. Rapid climate change and the world we live\\nin are complicated. So here is where YOU, dear viewer, come in\\nagain. Could YOU please fix the climate? A narrative of our time is that we are all\\nresponsible for rapid climate change. That everyone needs to play their part. Why don’t you buy a new electric car? Why don’t you replace your gas stove with\\nan electric one? How about you double glaze your windows, stop\\neating meat and switch off your lights? Shifting responsibility from the largest carbon\\nemitters to the average person, you, is much easier to do than solving problems. There’s an extra bonus if solving rapid\\nclimate change sells a new product. If you don’t have the money or time for\\nthese things, you should feel bad. It’s an effective message because it is\\ntrue. The quickest way to cut CO2 emissions would\\nbe if all rich populations on Earth drastically changed their lifestyles and if the people\\non the rise would not seek to achieve it. Favouring the climate over comfort and wealth. If you are able to watch this video, this\\nincludes you. But we’ve just witnessed a global experiment\\nin staying at home, not using transport and consuming less during the coronavirus pandemic. And all it did was reduce CO2 emissions by\\n7% for 2020. Asking average people to solve rapid climate\\nchange breaks down when we look at the scale of the problem. Personal contributions toward reducing greenhouse\\ngas emissions are nice, but they are dwarfed by the systemic reality of global emissions. The concept of your personal carbon footprint\\nwas popularized by the oil producer BP in a 2005 ad campaign. Arguably one of the most effective and sinister\\npieces of propaganda that still seriously distracts all of us from the reality of the\\nsituation. If you eliminated 100% of your emissions for\\nthe rest of your life, you would save one second’s worth of emissions from the global\\nenergy sector. Even the most motivated person can’t even\\nmake a tiny dent. When we put together the dangers of rapid\\nclimate change, the scale of emissions and the lack of consensus over how to solve it,\\nthe challenge seems insurmountable. It can cause decision fatigue and moral licensing,\\nwhere you no longer feel bad about behaving in a counter productive way. We have struggled a long time with this, which\\nis why this video took us so long to make. So. What can you actually do? There are many different takes and they are\\npassionately discussed. We don’t know who is right, so we can only\\noffer you the Kurzgesagt perspective and opinion. Opinion Part: What can you ACTUALLY do? We need a different way to think and talk\\nabout rapid climate change. An all-encompassing systemic approach, nothing\\nless than changing the fundamentals of our modern industrial societies. As discussed in frustrating length, the personal\\nresponsibility angle is overplayed. For systemic changes in technology, politics\\nand the economy of this magnitude, we need to influence the people at the levers. Politicians need to know and feel strongly\\nthat the people care, that their own success depends on tackling rapid climate change. When governments and local politicians are\\nreluctant to change laws that affect their biggest tax contributors or campaign donors,\\nwe need to vote them out and vote in people who respect science. We need to hold them accountable for implementing\\nthe most effective climate change strategies. Not waste our time with things like banning\\nplastic straws but by moving the big levers: Food, transportation and energy while not\\nforgetting the smaller ones like cement or construction. When industries fight against changing their\\nways, for fear of losses or in an honest attempt to protect their own, we need politicians\\nto change the laws and incentivise the deployment of existing technologies and massively invest\\nin innovation for the fields where we don’t have great solutions yet. There is no reason that the profit interests\\nof industries could not match the need to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible. And if they still don’t cooperate harsh\\npunishments and regulation need to force or bankrupt them. It's still unrealistic that change of that\\nscope can be forced onto a worldwide economy quickly enough, because many low carbon technologies\\nstill need a lot of time and research – which means they are expensive. But more companies will make more efficient\\ncarbon capture systems, tasty meat alternatives, better batteries, cement alternatives and\\nso on, if there is a clear and growing demand. And if you are affluent enough, you can do\\nyour part by investing in these things right now while they're still expensive. These are the mechanisms that will drive the\\nprices down later on. So this is basically what you can do. Vote at the ballot, vote with your wallet. There are too many opposing interests and\\ncomplicated grey zones. In the end if we truly get the systemic change\\nwe need, everybody will be unhappy about some aspect of it. Only if we all accept that some solutions\\nwill have negative impacts for us, can we have an honest conversation and make progress. Everybody will be a little unhappy. And that is ok. This is the best you can do. You can deal with the reality of the situation\\nand promote your priorities through your behaviour and your actions. And while you do so, you can eat less meat,\\nfly less or get an electric car. Not because you should feel guilty if you\\ndon’t or because you naively believe that you alone can stop rapid climate change – but\\nto do your tiny, tiny part for the systemic change we need.

viruses is a mystery\\xa0\\xa0 because how can something that needs victims\\xa0\\nto make more of itself emerge in the first\\xa0\\xa0 place there are many ideas viruses may have been\\xa0\\nessential steps in the emergence of life or maybe\\xa0\\xa0 they started out as escaped dna from cells that\\xa0\\nbecame really good at making copies of themselves\\xa0\\xa0 maybe they are the descendants of truly lazy\\xa0\\nparasites that let others do all the work for\\xa0\\xa0 them the current thinking is that viruses probably\\xa0\\nemerged multiple times from different

billion viruses on earth if we put them\\xa0\\xa0 all next to each other they would stretch for 100\\xa0\\nmillion light years 500 milky way galaxies wide\\xa0\\xa0 very recently viruses became even weirder\\xa0\\nwhen scientists found a completely new type\\xa0\\xa0 giant viruses nicknamed gyrus not only did it\\xa0\\nbreak all sorts of records but questioned many\\xa0\\xa0 assumptions we had about their nature gyruses\\xa0\\neven come with their own parasites virophages\\xa0\\xa0 viruses that hunt other viruses which seemingly\\xa0\\nmakes no sense at all and since we identified the\\xa0\\xa0 first one in 2003 it seems like these giants\\xa0\\nare everywhere we look in the oceans in water\\xa0\\xa0 towers in the guts of pigs and the mouths of\\xa0\\nhumans and they're even weirder than we thought\\xa0\\xa0 gyruses look funny like hairy geometric\\xa0\\nforms or mini pickles much larger than\\xa0\\xa0 all viruses we knew before which explains how\\xa0\\nthey could hide in plain sight for centuries\\xa0\\xa0 scientists saw them under their microscopes\\xa0\\nand just thought they had to be bacteria\\xa0\\xa0 it's like suddenly discovering there\\xa0\\nare elephant-sized ducks everywhere\\xa0\\xa0 most gyruses we've found so far hunt amoebi and\\xa0\\nother single-celled beings when they find a victim\\xa0\\xa0 they connect with it and use its natural processes\\xa0\\nto enter the cell like all viruses their goal is\\xa0\\xa0 to misappropriate the victim's infrastructure and\\xa0\\nprocreate imagine a mouse crawling into your mouth\\xa0\\xa0 and using your guts and bones and\\xa0\\nfat tissue to build a mouse factory\\xa0\\xa0 the gyrus unloads its attack proteins and genetic\\xa0\\nmaterial and rearranges the cell from the inside\\xa0\\xa0 its structural elements protein production\\xa0\\nmachinery and large amounts of mitochondria\\xa0\\xa0 for energy are changed to become an actual\\xa0\\nfactory called viroplasm some gyruses even\\xa0\\xa0 construct a membrane to shield them from the\\xa0\\ncell's antiviral defenses once finished the\\xa0\\xa0 viroplasm begins to assemble new gyruses using\\xa0\\nthe victim up from the inside until it's filled up\\xa0\\xa0 finally the invader usually orders the cell to\\xa0\\nself-destruct and releases new gyruses to look\\xa0\\xa0 for new prey but what makes gyruses special\\xa0\\nis not their modus operandi or their size even\\xa0\\xa0 it's that they are much more complex than thought\\xa0\\npossible for a virus your cells have around 20\\xa0\\xa0 000 genes a typical bacterium has a few thousand\\xa0\\ngenes the coronavirus has around 15 hiv or the flu\\xa0\\xa0 around 10. the number of genes alone is certainly\\xa0\\nnot everything the tomato for example has 35\\xa0\\xa0 000 genes but generally we think of life as a\\xa0\\ncomplex system so below a certain complexity level\\xa0\\xa0 something may be closer to dead material\\xa0\\nrather than a living organism but gyruses\\xa0\\xa0 can have hundreds or even thousands of genes\\xa0\\nblurring the line between living and dead things\\xa0\\xa0 and it's not just the numbers that are special\\xa0\\nbut also what these genes do we used to think of\\xa0\\xa0 viral genes as the simplest of instructions just\\xa0\\nenough to overcome the defense of their victims\\xa0\\xa0 and make new viruses but many gyrus genes\\xa0\\nare completely unique basically mystery genes\\xa0\\xa0 even more confusing a huge selection of their\\xa0\\ngenes that are actually hallmarks of living\\xa0\\xa0 things genes that regulate nutrient intake energy\\xa0\\nproduction light harvesting replication or are\\xa0\\xa0 just necessary to keep cells alive some recent\\xa0\\nstudies have even suggested that some gyruses\\xa0\\xa0 with very complex genomes may be able to maintain\\xa0\\na basic level of metabolism on their own which if\\xa0\\xa0 true will shake up what we thought of viruses\\xa0\\neven more we still don't know anything for sure\\xa0\\xa0 but one idea about gyrus genes is that they might\\xa0\\nfundamentally alter the physiology and evolution\\xa0\\xa0 of their victims by integrating their own genomes\\xa0\\nand merging with them into chimeric organisms\\xa0\\xa0 or the other way around take some host genes with\\xa0\\nthem and be changed themselves for billions of\\xa0\\xa0 years gyruses may have been existing alongside\\xa0\\nand infecting cells exerting an unseen influence\\xa0\\xa0 on the development of life not just as a parasite\\xa0\\nbut jerking evolution in different directions by\\xa0\\xa0 mixing genes around in all directions which brings\\xa0\\nus to another unique thing about them virophages\\xa0\\xa0 the viruses hunting gyruses the concept itself is\\xa0\\na bit mind-boggling how can a thing that might be\\xa0\\xa0 dead hunt another thing that might be dead too\\xa0\\nlet's look at one of them the viruphage sputnik\\xa0\\xa0 is hunting a gyrus called mama virus that\\xa0\\nitself is hunting amoebi sputnik is a tiny\\xa0\\xa0 minimalistic virus that doesn't even have\\xa0\\nthe genes and tools to replicate itself\\xa0\\xa0 what it does have is the ability to hijack the\\xa0\\nviroplasm factories of mama viruses so virophages\\xa0\\xa0 need their victim the gyrus to infect their victim\\xa0\\nan amoeba first and then they can parasitize it\\xa0\\xa0 a memovirus viroplasm infected by sputnik can only\\xa0\\nproduce very few new gyruses and among these many\\xa0\\xa0 are deformed and broken unable to infect further\\xa0\\ncells instead it makes loads of new sputnik\\xa0\\xa0 viruphages other virophages are even more subtle\\xa0\\nwhen they infect a viroplasm they just integrate\\xa0\\xa0 their genetic code into the newly produced gyruses\\xa0\\nlike sleeper agents the next time one of these\\xa0\\xa0 infiltrated gyruses successfully infects a cell\\xa0\\nit produces mostly viruphages instead of gyruses\\xa0\\xa0 gyruses are not completely defenseless\\xa0\\nthough a few years ago the world was in\\xa0\\xa0 awe when scientists discovered crispr a bacterial\\xa0\\ndefense system against viruses it turns out some\\xa0\\xa0 gyruses have a system that might be similar a\\xa0\\nsort of gyrus immune system against virophages\\xa0\\xa0 in turn virophages can also be used as an\\xa0\\nantigyrus defense mechanism by living cells\\xa0\\xa0 some protests have been found that integrated the\\xa0\\ngenetic code of virophages into their genome and\\xa0\\xa0 kept it when the protists were infected by gyruses\\xa0\\nthey used the code to create virophages themselves\\xa0\\xa0 to take over the gyrus factories in the end\\xa0\\nthe protists would still be killed by the gyrus\\xa0\\xa0 infection but instead of releasing gyruses to kill\\xa0\\nits buddies it released virophages to hunt them\\xa0\\xa0 the amazing thing about everything we've told you\\xa0\\nin this video is that we're still very much at the\\xa0\\xa0 beginning it's not even been 20 years since the\\xa0\\ndiscovery of gyruses and virophages there is so\\xa0\\xa0 much going on in the microverse life is not an\\xa0\\nisolated event but a ping pong game of trillions\\xa0\\xa0 of organisms and viruses so when you feel down and\\xa0\\nlike there's not that much new to discover think\\xa0\\xa0 of gyruses and all the other elephant-sized ducks\\xa0\\nall around us invisible until we look more closely\\xa0\\xa0\", \"the human immune system is the most complex biological system we know after the human brain and yet most of us never learn how it works or what it is your immune system consists of hundreds of tiny and two large organs it has its own transport Network spread throughout your body every day it makes hundreds of billions of fresh cells organized like an army with soldiers captains Intelligence Officers heavy weapons and crazy suicide bombers it's not some sort of abstract entity your immune system is you your biology protecting you from the billions of microorganisms that want to consume you and from your own perverted cells that turn into cancer it's so manifold that it's impossible to cover in one video so we'll make a series looking at different aspects of it today what happens when your body is invaded and your first lines of defenses are engaged in a fight for life and [Music] death it's been a normal day when suddenly the world explodes and an asteroid rips the sky open countless alien life forms invade ready to destroy cities and infrastructure and eat civilians or this is what your cells experience you look at your bleeding thumb that you just cut on a dirty twig in the park how annoying but inside the wound a horrible catastrophe has happened there are dead cells and blood and dirt everywhere even worse countless bacteria invade the warm Caverns between your helpless cells to explore their new home steal your resources and poop everywhere immediately the first stage of your defense kicks in the cells that survived the impact or are hurt or dying scream in panic releasing an onslaught of chemical alarm signals that awaken your immune system the first cells to show up are macrofagos if an average cell were the size of a human a maccrage would be the size of a black rhino a stoic cell in principle but you wouldn't want to annoy it bacteria do annoy them within seconds the large cells attack and begin killing them without Mercy they stretch out Parts like the Arms of an octopus and grab the bacteria to swallow them whole and digest them alive a maccrage can eat 100 bacteria before it's exhausted but there are too many enemies so the maccrage is call for reinforcements in your blood hundreds of thousands of neutrophils pick up their signals and move to the battlefield neutrophils are intense suicide Warriors that only live to kill they're so enthusiastic itic about killing that they kill themselves a few days after birth so they don't have time to accidentally destroy your body from the inside as soon as neutrophils arrive they begin vomiting deadly chemicals at bacteria or devour them they are so careless in their attacks that they are causing real damage to your own cells but collateral damage is not their concern now orever some neutrophils go so far to push their suicide button and explode casting wide and toxic Nets made from their own DNA filled with deadly chemicals that trap and kill bacteria sometimes they can continue fighting after that even though they're sort of dead already this is how much fun they have killing while the battle rages your blood vessels let fluid stream into the battlefield like a dam opening up towards a valley you notice this as inflammation your thumb swells up a little and gets red and warm the fluid brings a silent killer into the Battle Zone millions of compliment proteins a sort of automated liquid weapon that stuns and kills bacteria by ripping holes into them we made a whole video explaining them in detail we're reaching a crossroad now if things go well your first line of defense kills the Invaders quickly but sometimes the enemies are too strong and would overwhelm your defenses eventually which means certain death for you the human this is the hour of the dendritic cell your immune system's intelligence officer while your soldiers were bashing in heads it was collecting samples by ripping bacteria into tiny parts and covering itself in it like a soldier decorating itself in the guts of a dead enemy the cell leaves the battlefield and enters the Super Highway of your immune system that connects all your tissues with your immune headquarters your lymph nodes the dendritic cell coming from the battlefield is looking for a helper te cell which is a sort of allpurpose Commander cell within your immune Army but not any helper te cell one that happens to have just the right weapon for the bacteria that infected your wound so it goes around and rubs itself still covered in bacteria Parts against every helper tea cell it meets most tea cells are a bit disgusted and not interested but after a few hours something clicks a helper te cell recognizes the bacteria parts this cell is the weapon that's needed right now the dendritic cell is overjoyed and activates the helper te cell okay wait how come your immune system has a cell that has a weapon against the specific bacteria that infected you well your immune system has a perfect weapon against every possible disease in the universe against the Black Death the Corona virus or an infection that will emerge in 100 years on Mars we'll talk about this a bit more in the the next video because it's very complex so for now just know that you have billions of unique helper te cells that each have weapons against every possible enemy after the right t- cell is activated your second line of defense awakes and Rises like a teenager that needs to get up on a school day very slowly your heavy weapons are incredibly effective but they're not fast the activated helper te cell begins to clone itself over and over again one becomes two two become four until there are thousands of them now they split into two groups the first group quickly moves to help out your soldiers at the battlefield things are getting out of hand a tired maccrage is ready to give up after fighting for days it just wants to go to sleep like many of its buddies have done already but now the helper tea cells arrive one of them comes to the tired maccrage and Whispers something using special chemical signals in a heartbeat the demoralized soldier feels fresh again but there's something else a hot white anger the maccrage knows what it needs to do kill invigorated it throws itself against the enemies once again all over the battlefield this begins to happen meanwhile the second group of hel cells was working on activating another line of defense B cells your antibody factories antibodies are protein super weapons that look like tiny crabs with two Pines to grab enemies just like the helper T cells there are B cells in your body that are able to make just the right antibodies for every possible enemy and the helper T cell is looking for exactly these B cells after a day or two the right B cell is found and begins to clone itself as soon as enough clones have been made each B cell begins pumping out up to 2,000 antibodies per second about a week after you injured yourself and bacteria invaded your second line of defense finally arrives in full force the tiny Army begins to saturate the battlefield pinching and stunning desperate bacteria the antibodies Clump them together and make them unable to move or fight while your soldiers Massacre the defenseless victims the tide is turning fast as the last enemies are cleaned up your soldiers realize they are no longer needed and begin to kill themselves to save resources but not all of them a few helper te cells remain and turn into memory cells they will guard the tissue for years making sure the same bacteria will never again gain a foothold here similarly a few B cells will stay alive and keep producing a low amount of antibodies making you immune against this bacteria maybe for the rest of your life one day you wake up and notice that the wound has grown over and left nothing but but a faint red mark you were completely unaware of the drama yourselves had to deal with for you the whole ordeal was a slight annoyance while for millions of cells it was a desperate fight for life and death but this is just the

holes.\\xa0\\xa0 In contrast to things like planets or\\xa0\\nstars they have no physical size limit,\\xa0\\xa0 and can literally grow endlessly. Although in\\xa0\\nreality specific things need to happen to create\\xa0\\xa0 different kinds of black holes, from really tiny\\xa0\\nones to the largest single things in the universe.\\xa0\\xa0 So how do black holes grow and how\\xa0\\nlarge is the largest of them all? This video will not discuss how black holes work\\xa0\\nor how they form since we’ve looked at that in\\xa0\\xa0 detail in our black hole and neutron star series,\\xa0\\nyou can check them out afterwards. For now we are\\xa0\\xa0 interested in finding the largest thing in the\\xa0\\nuniverse. Let us start really, really small. Primordial Black holes The smallest kind of black holes may or may not\\xa0\\nexist. If they do, they are probably the oldest\\xa0\\xa0 objects in the universe, older even than atoms.\\xa0\\nThey would have formed just after the big bang,\\xa0\\xa0 when the universe was so dense with\\xa0\\nviolent energy, that any tiny pocket\\xa0\\xa0 that was just slightly more dense than\\xa0\\nits neighbors could produce a black hole. The smallest Primordial Black Hole that\\xa0\\ncould still be around would be a trillion\\xa0\\xa0 kilograms or so, the mass of a big mountain.\\xa0\\nAnd yet they would be no bigger than a proton.\\xa0\\xa0 A Primordial Black hole with the mass of\\xa0\\nearth would barely be larger than a coin.\\xa0\\xa0 This makes them very hard to find, so we\\xa0\\nhaven’t actually observed any yet – if\\xa0\\xa0 they exist they may even be the mysterious\\xa0\\ndark matter that holds galaxies together. Let’s move on to the kinds of black holes\\xa0\\nthat we know for sure ARE out there. Stellar Black Holes To make a black hole we need to compress enough\\xa0\\nmatter so that it collapses into itself. After\\xa0\\xa0 that, the more mass we throw at it, the\\xa0\\nlarger it becomes. In today's universe,\\xa0\\xa0 only the most violent cosmic events can create\\xa0\\nthe necessary conditions, such as the merger of\\xa0\\xa0 neutron stars or when the core of a very massive\\xa0\\nstar collapses in a supernova. To have a unit to\\xa0\\xa0 work with here, we’ll use the mass of our sun,\\xa0\\nabout 2 million trillion trillion kilograms. The smallest known black hole\\xa0\\nhas 2.7 times the mass of the sun\\xa0\\xa0 which works out as a sphere around 16 km\\xa0\\nin diameter, large enough to cover Paris. Another lightweight black hole is the\\xa0\\ncompanion to the V723 Mon red giant star.\\xa0\\xa0 This star is 24 times larger than our sun,\\xa0\\n30 million kilometer in diameter. And yet,\\xa0\\xa0 it is thrown around by a tiny black hole\\xa0\\njust 17.2 km wide. This tiny thing bullying\\xa0\\xa0 the star is so much smaller that we can\\xa0\\nbarely even show them in comparison. One of the largest known stellar black holes is\\xa0\\nM33 X-7. It currently spends its time eating a 70\\xa0\\xa0 solar mass blue giant, bit by bit. As all that\\xa0\\nstolen matter circles towards the black hole,\\xa0\\xa0 like water going down a drain, friction heats\\xa0\\nit up to temperatures high enough to shine\\xa0\\xa0 500,000 times brighter than our Sun! And\\xa0\\nyet, X-7 is ‘only’ 15.65 solar masses\\xa0\\xa0 and 92 km wide, just big enough\\xa0\\nto cast a shadow on Corsica. To grow much larger, black holes have to either\\xa0\\ndevour a lot of stars or better, merge with one\\xa0\\xa0 another. The instruments that make it possible\\xa0\\nto detect these mergers are very new so we are\\xa0\\xa0 currently discovering a lot of exciting things.\\xa0\\nLike two massive black holes that we detected in\\xa0\\xa0 a galaxy 17 billion lightyears away. As they spun\\xa0\\naround each other violently, they released more\\xa0\\xa0 energy in the form of gravitational waves than the\\xa0\\ncombined light from all the stars in the milky way\\xa0\\xa0 in 4400 years. The new black hole they formed is\\xa0\\nabout the size of Germany and is 142 solar masses. And here we hit a curious gap in scale. There are lots of black holes up to 150 solar\\xa0\\nmasses. And then there is nothing for a long\\xa0\\xa0 time. Until we suddenly hit black holes,\\xa0\\nthat are millions of times more massive. Which is a bit confusing, because we had this\\xa0\\nidea that black holes are consistently growing\\xa0\\xa0 and growing. But for the most massive black holes\\xa0\\nthis process is not fast enough to explain their\\xa0\\xa0 existence today. The universe is simply not\\xa0\\nold enough for these supermassive black holes\\xa0\\xa0 to have formed by eating stars and merging with\\xa0\\neach other. Something else must have happened. To explain how we got the largest black\\xa0\\nholes in the universe, we might need the\\xa0\\xa0 largest stars that ever existed: Quasi Stars.\\xa0\\nTo get a sense of scale, we can compare them\\xa0\\xa0 to the largest stars that exist today. Our\\xa0\\nSun is like a grain of sand next to them. We don’t know if Quasi Stars actually existed but\\xa0\\nthey are an interesting concept when it comes to\\xa0\\xa0 supercharging black hole development. The idea is\\xa0\\nthat the matter in the early universe was so dense\\xa0\\xa0 that quasi stars could grow to thousands of\\xa0\\ntimes the mass of our sun. The cores of these\\xa0\\xa0 stars might have been crushed by their own weight\\xa0\\nso much to actually collapse into black holes\\xa0\\xa0 while the star was still forming. In contrast to\\xa0\\nstars today that would destroy themselves in the\\xa0\\xa0 process, inside quasi stars, a deadly balance\\xa0\\ncould emerge. Gravity pressed the supermassive\\xa0\\xa0 star together, feeding the black hole and heating\\xa0\\nthe material falling in to such a degree that the\\xa0\\xa0 radiation pressure kept the star stable. And so\\xa0\\nthese quickly growing black holes might have been\\xa0\\xa0 able to consume the quasi star for millions of\\xa0\\nyears and grow far bigger than any modern stellar\\xa0\\xa0 black hole. Black holes several thousand times the\\xa0\\nmass of the Sun and wider than the entire earth. These black holes might have become\\xa0\\nthe seeds for supermassive black holes. Supermassive black holes So now, we arrive at the kings of our\\xa0\\nuniverse, the largest single bodies in\\xa0\\xa0 existence. The centers of most galaxies contain a\\xa0\\nsuper massive black hole, and they are monstrous. In the Milky Way we have Sagittarius A\\xa0\\nStar, a super massive black hole with\\xa0\\xa0 about 4 million solar masses that is calm and\\xa0\\ncollected and just does its thing. We know\\xa0\\xa0 it sits there because we can see a number of stars\\xa0\\nbeing thrown around by a seemingly empty spot.\\xa0\\xa0 And despite its incredible\\xa0\\nmass, it’s radius is still\\xa0\\xa0 only 17 times our sun. Smaller than most giant\\xa0\\nstars, but millions of times more massive. Because Supermassive black holes are so\\xa0\\nmassive and located at the center of galaxies,\\xa0\\xa0 many people imagine them as being a bit like\\xa0\\nthe Sun in the solar system. An anchor that\\xa0\\xa0 glues everything else together and forces it into\\xa0\\nan orbit. But this is a misconception. While the\\xa0\\xa0 sun makes up 99.86% of all the mass in the solar\\xa0\\nsystem, SuperMassive Black Holes usually only have\\xa0\\xa0 0.001% of the mass of their galaxy. The billions\\xa0\\nof stars in galaxies are not gravitationally\\xa0\\xa0 bound to them, instead it is the gravitational\\xa0\\neffect of dark matter which holds them together. Many supermassive black holes aren’t gentle\\xa0\\ngiants, especially when they are feeding on\\xa0\\xa0 the clouds of mass in their galaxy. The one at the\\xa0\\ncenter of the BL Lacertae galaxy is devouring so\\xa0\\xa0 much material that it produces jets of plasma\\xa0\\naccelerated to nearly the speed of light.\\xa0\\xa0 If Earth were orbiting this huge body, it would\\xa0\\nseem 115 times larger than our Sun in the sky…\\xa0\\xa0 and we’d be burnt to a crisp in seconds\\xa0\\nby its glowing hot accretion disk. At this point black holes become so large that\\xa0\\nstars seem ridiculously tiny compared to them. The galaxy Cygnus A has a super massive black hole\\xa0\\nwith 2.5 billion solar masses and 14.7 billion km\\xa0\\xa0 wide, which would mean that if it took the place\\xa0\\nof our Sun, it would swallow all the planets and\\xa0\\xa0 stretch halfway to the edge of our Solar System.\\xa0\\nIt is devouring so much mass and material that it\\xa0\\xa0 churns its disk into a kind of magnetic funnel,\\xa0\\nspewing gas out making tremendous radio lobes,\\xa0\\xa0 towering over the galaxy, half a million light\\xa0\\nyears in diameter. That is 2.5 Milkyways wide. Another pretty large Super Massive Black\\xa0\\nhole sits in the galaxy Messier 87. It\\xa0\\xa0 has 6.5 billion solar masses and was the\\xa0\\nfirst black hole we got an actual photo of.\\xa0\\xa0 Or rather of the glowing gas around\\xa0\\nthe edge of a menacing shadow.\\xa0\\xa0 This sphere of darkness is so large\\xa0\\nthat it covers our entire Solar System. And yet, there is a scale even\\xa0\\nabove these kinds of objects... Ultramassive black holes Now we reach the most massive black holes, perhaps\\xa0\\nthe largest single bodies that will ever exist.\\xa0\\xa0 These black holes have eaten so much that they've\\xa0\\ngrown to tens of billions of solar masses, their\\xa0\\xa0 gravity the engine for a ‘quasar’- an accretion\\xa0\\ndisk shining brighter than thousands of galaxies\\xa0\\xa0 full of stars. So massive that they deserve a\\xa0\\ntitle of their own - Ultramassive Black Holes. The Ultra Massive Black Hole at the center of\\xa0\\ngalaxy OJ 287 is 18 billion solar masses. It\\xa0\\xa0 is so big that it has a Super Massive black hole,\\xa0\\nnearly forty times larger than sagittarius A star,\\xa0\\xa0 orbiting it! This thing defies imagination\\xa0\\nand is really hard to compare to anything.\\xa0\\xa0 It can comfortably fit three Solar\\xa0\\nSystems side by side inside of it. Let us end this insane competition\\xa0\\nand get to the king of kings. TON 618, a black hole that we can observe\\xa0\\nconsuming galaxies worth of matter is\\xa0\\xa0 shining with the brightness of a hundred trillion\\xa0\\nstars, visible from 18 billion light years away.\\xa0\\xa0 It has an incredible 66 billion solar masses.\\xa0\\nA black hole so large that it would take light\\xa0\\xa0 a week to reach the singularity after\\xa0\\ncrossing the event horizon. About 11\\xa0\\xa0 Solar Systems could sit inside of it side\\xa0\\nby side. It may very well be the largest\\xa0\\xa0 single body in the universe. But in\\xa0\\nreality, it is probably even larger.\\xa0\\xa0 Since TON 618 is so far away, we only see\\xa0\\nwhat it looked like 10 billion years ago. In any case, black holes are scary and mysterious\\xa0\\xa0 and gigantic. They will be here after everything\\xa0\\nelse dies, and growing larger and larger. So now let us do the trip again. From\\xa0\\nthe smallest possible black hole,\\xa0\\xa0 all the way up to the largest. Let’s try something new today,\\xa0\\nwe can call it: “Behind the Lies”\\xa0\\xa0 a short behind the scenes bit about the\\xa0\\nnecessary inaccuracies in this video\\xa0\\xa0 because it's really not actually possible\\xa0\\nto rank black holes like trading cards. How so? Well, while we have catalogued\\xa0\\nmillions of stars, we really only have\\xa0\\xa0 good data on a couple of dozen black holes.\\xa0\\nThat’s because black hole gazing wasn’t really\\xa0\\xa0 a thing until 50 years ago – and technically\\xa0\\nstill isn’t, because we can’t see black holes. We can only derive their properties from studying\\xa0\\ntheir gravitational effects on the matter around\\xa0\\xa0 them, like the orbit of stars that come close\\xa0\\nto them. This effect depends on the mass of the\\xa0\\xa0 black hole, which we can approximate at\\xa0\\nthe most basic level with Kepler’s Laws.\\xa0\\xa0 But this comes with huge\\xa0\\nuncertainties and error bars.\\xa0\\xa0 Then we have to convert mass to size\\xa0\\nnext, which brings new uncertainties.\\xa0\\xa0 For example, we calculated the radius from the\\xa0\\nmass using the Schwarzschild equation which for\\xa0\\xa0 the sake of simplicity assumes black holes are\\xa0\\nperfectly round and don’t spin: a kind of black\\xa0\\xa0 hole that doesn’t really exist. The reality is\\xa0\\nthat physics on these scales is a bit fuzzy. So some of the black holes we talked about\\xa0\\nhere may be way smaller or way bigger. We\\xa0\\xa0 just don’t know for sure. We shimmied around\\xa0\\nthis problem by comparing different sources\\xa0\\xa0 with different kinds of values and using\\xa0\\ndifferent mass calculations to arrive\\xa0\\xa0 at a standardized list that allowed us\\xa0\\nto be as accurate as humanly possible.\\xa0\\xa0 You can look at all of this in our source doc. As\\xa0\\na result this script was written with the tears of\\xa0\\xa0 experts we drove crazy with our obsession\\xa0\\nfor the best values they could live with. In this process, tons of stuff\\xa0\\ngot cut and didn’t make it into\\xa0\\xa0 the final video – but luckily we\\xa0\\nfound a way to not waste all of it: We created a lot of black hole merch, spanning the\\xa0\\nwhole range from somewhat bonkers to more serious.\\xa0\\xa0 This way we get to explore a topic\\xa0\\nfrom different angles – and you\\xa0\\xa0 get to continue having fun with\\xa0\\nblack holes after this video ends.\", \"Leaving earth to find new homes in space is\\nan old dream of humanity and will sooner or later be necessary for our survival. The planet\\nthat gets the most attention is Mars, a small, toxic and energy poor planet that just about\\nseems good enough for a colony of depressed humans huddled in underground cities. But what if we think bigger? What if we take\\nVenus, one of the most hostile and deadly places in the solar system and turn IT into\\na colony? Not by building lofty cloud cities, but by creating a proper second earth? It\\nmight be easier than you think. Venus is by far the hottest planet in the\\nsolar system with a surface temperature of 460°C, hot enough to melt lead. This heat\\nis due to the most extreme greenhouse effect in the solar system. CO2 is great at trapping\\nheat – even a rise from 0.03% to 0.04% in Earth's atmosphere is heating up our planet\\nright now. Venus's atmosphere is 97% CO2. Also, Venus's atmosphere is 93 times denser\\nthan earth’s. Standing on Venus’ surface would feel like taking a dive about 900 meters\\ndeep into the ocean. The pressure would kill you instantly. It’s a truly horrible place! So why should\\nwe even bother? First and foremost, Venus is almost as big\\nas Earth and has 90% of its surface gravity. Surface gravity is a big problem when colonizing\\nthe solar system because it is very likely that long stays in low gravity places will\\nhave negative health effects. Venus’ size means it could be the second\\nlargest habitat in the solar system. A new home for billions of humans and trillions\\nof animals. With oceans, lush forests and a beautiful blue sky. A properly terraformed\\nVenus may be the most pleasant place to live outside of Earth. While we can’t exactly terraform Venus today,\\na slightly more ambitious future version of us COULD take this project on. It will take\\na few generations to complete and be a huge challenge – like building the great pyramids\\nwas for our ancestors. But then it’s not like humans have never started projects that\\ntook more than a lifetime to complete. Ok! Let’s do it! Before anything else, we need to cool Venus\\ndown and remove the gas that makes up the extremely heavy atmosphere. As mentioned,\\nthere is a lot of it. Around 465 million billion tons. How do we do that? There are a few options.\\nWe could create giant solar collectors powering a huge array of laser beams, that heat up\\nthe atmosphere so much that it is blasted into space. Although we would need thousands\\nof times the entire power generating capacity of humanity and it would still take thousands\\nof years to remove the atmosphere. Another way is to sequester the atmosphere.\\nBinding the CO2 in different compounds through chemical reactions. We could mine elements\\nlike Calcium or Magnesium on Mercury and shoot them at Venus via mass driver systems – Electric\\nrails that make rockets unnecessary on smaller planets. The metals would combine to bind\\nthe CO2 into different carbonates basically forever. But the scale makes the whole thing\\nimpractical. We would need several hundred billion tons of material to sequester the\\nCO2 this way. Seems like a waste of material and might take too long. An equally ridiculous idea that could actually\\nwork is to put Venus in the shade. Literally. By constructing a huge mirror to blot out\\nthe sun to just freeze the atmosphere. The mirror does not need to be complex or massive,\\njust a very thin foil with a little structural support. Building such a large flat surface\\nso close to the sun will turn it effectively into a solar sail and push it out of position,\\nso instead of one giant circular object, our mirror will consist of many different pieces. Annular slats of angled mirrors can reflect\\nsunlight from one set of mirrors to the next. Mirrors would be angled, reflecting light\\nfrom one to another until the light is redirected to the back - balancing the force on the front\\nand holding them in position. After a few years of getting the infrastructure\\nin place, things start slowly and then escalate. For the first few decades, the atmosphere\\nslowly cools down but stays dense and deadly. Until, after some 60 years it reaches the\\ncritical temperature of 31° Celsius. Suddenly, the Great Flood begins on Venus, as CO2 turns\\nto liquid at this pressure and begins to rain down- a constant global rainstorm of unbelievable\\nproportions lasting 30 years. The pressure and temperature suddenly begin to drop in\\nunison. For almost a century, puddles turn into lakes and oceans. The surface temperature is now -56° Celsius\\nand the pressure has dropped to only seven times the pressure on earth. Finally, at a\\nreally unpleasant -81°, the CO2 oceans begin to freeze and the rain turns into snow. This\\nleaves us with a frozen Venus covered in oceans as hard as rock and gigantic CO2 glaciers.\\nWhat remains of the atmosphere is mostly nitrogen, at about 3 times earth’s surface pressure.\\nIf you don’t mind freezing and suffocating, you can now take a stroll over Venus' surface. But the frozen CO2 remains a bit of a problem.\\nAt some point we want to warm up the planet, but if we do, the CO2 ice will melt and fill\\nup the atmosphere again. So we need some way to keep it from doing\\nthat. One is to simply cover it all with cheap plastic\\ninsulation and cover it up with ground-up venus rock or water oceans. Although some\\nplanetary scientists will be very stressed out about us building a new planet containing\\na potential timebomb like that. A few unfortunately timed volcanoes could melt a lot of CO2 at\\nonce and ruin everything. Another obvious solution is to shoot it all\\nout into space and collect it into a small moon for storage and future use. We can make\\nthis more efficient by using mass drivers instead of rockets, but moving all that mass\\nwill still be a pretty intense challenge that will take some time to solve. Whatever we end up doing with the atmosphere,\\nto move forward we need water, which we could get from Ice-Moons. Europa, a moon of Jupiter,\\nhas twice as much water as Earth’s oceans. Now catching a moon and transporting it through\\nthe solar system is not exactly easy. So instead it might be easier to cut chunks\\nof ice off Europa with an army of construction drones and shoot them at Venus using more\\nof those mass drivers. Space tethers could save us a lot of effort and energy here – we\\nmade a whole video explaining how they work, but in a nutshell, they are slings that can\\ntake a payload on both ends. On Europa, they do most of the work needed\\nto catapult our ice to Venus. The ice hits the Venus tethers, which gently drop it into\\nthe atmosphere, where it falls down as snow. In exchange, the Venus tethers get to catch\\nCO2 ice shot up from below and accelerate it into orbit.\\nWe can remove excess nitrogen using this same method to further lower our atmospheric pressure. After a few decades or centuries, Venus would\\nbe covered by a nice, shallow frozen ocean a few hundred meters deep. It would look extremely\\ndifferent from today. A few continents and countless islands have formed. This is beginning\\nto look a bit like our planet! Now the last and most magnificent phase of\\nterraforming begins: Making the atmosphere breathable and adding life. First we need light though and we need to\\nheat the planet up again. A Venus day is 2802 hours long. More than 116 Earth days. So if\\nwe just remove our giant mirror, we would grill half of our planet. Even without the\\nmassive atmosphere, temperatures would reach unbearable levels. The simplest way to create\\na day/night cycle and let some energy in again, is with another set of mirrors to illuminate\\nour continents and melt our water oceans. Which would let us completely control how\\nmuch energy we get and where it goes. The atmosphere is now mostly made up of nitrogen\\nand basically devoid of oxygen. So the first inhabitants will likely be trillions and trillions\\nof Cyanobacteria, which can get photosynthesising and release oxygen. We know that they can\\nquickly turn around the atmosphere of a planet because billions of years ago, they were probably\\nresponsible for turning the toxic atmosphere of our young Earth into an atmosphere with\\nenough oxygen for more complex animal life. But not only that – Cyanobacteria can fix\\nNitrogen from the atmosphere and turn it into nutrients that can be used by living beings.\\nThis way they will essentially fertilize our dead ocean water and prepare it for more complex\\norganisms. On land, our colonists need to grind down\\nsome of the former venusian surface to make soil for nitrogen fixing plants to grow on.\\nEventually billions of trees would spread creating large forests, covering massive parts\\nof the continents. Venus would turn green. First the oceans, then the land. To speed\\nthings up, CO2 would be strategically released to supply the plants and cyanobacteria. Areas\\nalready covered with plants could get extra daylight from our orbital mirrors, so the\\nplants would be active for most of each day. Maybe, we won’t have to do this with the\\nsame plants and animals we know today. As genetic engineering matures and our understanding\\nof genetics and the machinery of life expands, we might just engineer life as we need it. All in all, it would take several thousand\\nyears to make the atmosphere breathable by humans. In the meantime, you could stroll\\naround with nothing more than regular clothes and an oxygen mask. Settlers would enjoy a\\nvast new planet, filled with resources and bathed in sunlight. They might think of new\\nways to use the vast amounts of carbon dioxide ice and nitrogen orbiting in space above.\\nIndustrial processes, rocket fuel or even boosting the terraforming of another planet,\\nlike tiny Mars Venus is fully terraformed. Animals roam through\\nvast ecosystems. Cities are being constructed. Billions of settlers and their descendants\\nmake this world their home. They will see images of the past. How Venus was once the\\nmost hostile planet around. How it took hundreds of years to freeze hell and to ship in the\\noceans and another few thousand years to make it possible to breathe freely. They will barely\\nbe able to believe it. Ok. Maybe it is not that easy to terraform\\nVenus and a lot of things must go right for this future to become reality. But it is possible\\nand with technology that is within the reach of a motivated and slightly more advanced\\nhumanity that wants to venture into space. The only thing that is stopping it is our\\nimagination. And that at least is a problem\", \"one of the greatest Illusions in life is continuity 66 million years ago the continuity of the dinosaurs had been going on for around 165 million years already and it didn't seem this would change anytime soon the world was warm and pleasant and most of the land was covered with Lush forests and an incredible diversity of trees flowers Ferns and trillions of Critters dinosaurs were ubiquity and had Diversified into hundreds of species of all shapes and sizes titanor large gentle Giants shared the world with famous beasts like Tyrannosaurus rex or Edmontosaurus pectinodon hunted in the undergrowth while Edmontosaurus wandered coastlines and swamps an ancient Paradise a world of planty Full of Life 66 million years ago May on a Tuesday afternoon life was the same as it had been the day before or a thousand years before or pretty much a million years before things were good for Our Feathered dinosaur buddies until a tiny tiny detail in the sky [Music] changed if there were dinosaurs watching the Stars one night they may have noticed the appearance of a new star a tiny dot that for many weeks slowly became bigger and brighter until one fateful day it looked like another small moon in the night sky and then it faded from sight as it dipped into Earth's Shadow for a few more hours the illusion of continuity was upheld until it was not anymore in the morning the object suddenly appears again now almost as large as the sun in the sky and growing every moment heading for the coast near the yakatan peninsula it takes the asteroid only seconds to pass through the thin layer between space and the ground to make contact as it enters the atmosphere at almost 60 times the speed of sound let's stop time here we see the unnamed asteroid about to commit species side larger than Mount aest it reaches from the ocean High into the atmosphere High than passenger planes would fly millions of years later at this moment the world was one way in a fraction of a second it would be fundamentally different let's make the transition as the asteroid hits the shallow ocean and the Bedrock below the energy of billions of nuclear weapons is released all at once as the asteroid vaporizes a flash of light illuminates the sky as an eerie bright white sphere grows over the Gulf of Mexico Bedrock melts into seething hot plasma at tens of thousands of De C the thermal radiation from the explosion travels at the speed of light and immediately Burns everything within a radius of about 1,500 km while the energy from the impact pushes so hard against Earth's crust that it loses all strength and flows away from the impact site like a liquid creating a hole 25 km deep and 100 km wide the o is pushed back for hundreds of kilom like when a kit jumps into a puddle as the crust bounces back melted and flowing crust forms a temporary Mountain stretching 10 km into the sky an incredible amount of material is blasted into the higher atmosphere or even out into space as much as 60 times the original mass of the asteroid the violence of the strike is felt everywhere on Earth within minutes a magnitude 11 earthquake maybe the most powerful Quake any living thing has ever witnessed in billions of years it is so insanely strong that in India it might have shaken gigantic lava fields and causes volcanic eruptions that would last for 30,000 years and cover half of the Indian subcontinent with lava even on the side of Earth opposite the impact the ground still moved by several meters nobody would sleep through this day the gigantic EXP explosion crashes against the atmosphere with unprecedented violence and causes a shock wave that reaches speeds of more than 1,000 km per hour near the sight of impact similar to the hyper hurricanes on gas giants like Neptune in Middle America basically any soil vegetation or animal is just shredded into pieces and catapulted thousands of kilometers away now the previously displaced oceans return as the temporary Mountain at the sight of impact collapses a ring of tsunami is as high as 1 km enough to cover all skyscrapers humans would ever build heads in all directions as they crash into the coasts of the continents surrounding the impact they will drown thousands of kilometers of Coastline 15 hours later some of the waves that get refracted around South America will still Tower as much as 100 m into the sky but we still haven't talked about the worst thing yet a lot of the debris yeeted into space will orbit Earth for thousands of years some may hit the moon or even Mars but most of it comes right back when Things fall through the atmosphere at such speeds they get very hot as in hundreds of degrees hot and this happens to millions of tons of material everywhere this rapidly heats up the atmosphere to insane temperatures we don't know exactly how hot it got or how long this heat shock lasted but there are two ideas here either the air was heated to hundreds of De for a few minutes or 2,000s of De for around 1 minute in any case the air became as hot as the inside of an industrial oven how bad the global effects of this were is contested but if enough heat reached the surface a lot of plants and animals would have died very quickly if they couldn't bury themselves or Escape into caves the heat together with raining debris Also may have ignited material on Forest floors and sparked wildfires as the Earth rotated under the Searing hot blue in a few hours massive wildfires were probably burning around the globe some of them may have lasted for months and turned Earth into a horrifying hot hellish version of itself as the day of the impact draws to an end many of the dinosaurs are already dead but the worst is still to come the gigantic plume of vaporized material reaches the upper atmosphere and spreads around the whole globe together with the S from the burning planet and the aerosol generated at impact the planet sinks into a deep Darkness with only the remaining raging fires Illuminating the scenery whatever plants survive the firestorms will now be starved for sunlight AS Global photosynthesis is temporarily shut down within days temperatures crash as much as 25° C the oceans were especially hard hit the lack of sunlight killed over 90% of Plankton which formed the basis of the food food web of marine life ultimately this would kill off the large marine reptiles and ammonites that used to dominate The Seas the biosphere the survivors Now find themselves in is like an alien landscape Ash debris and the burned remains of the formerly Lush and blooming life cover the ground the sky is dark and it's cold and fresh food is scarce while fungi Thrive for months and years the planet will be a hostile and deadly place the sudden Global Winter will last for decades at least 75% of all species on Earth will just vanish from existence and so as the day ends the world is suddenly different the continuity that went on for millions of years is no more the era of the dinosaurs is over just like that eventually From the Ashes of the old world survivors emerged birds that are the direct descendants of the dinosaurs and mammals that would eventually become the dominant animals on the planet without the asteroid who knows what life on Earth would look like today without the sudden disruption of dinosaur continuity that completely changed the planet and all life on it we might have never had the opportunity to become what we are today it's not clear how long the human era will last so so far modern humans have been around for 0.1% of the time the dinosaurs were and in this short amount of time we've achieved impressive Feats from making the world our own to reaching space and splitting the atom yet our future and our long-term survival are not a given if we're not careful it could end in an instant like the age of the dinosaurs end it but in contrast to them we know that our continuity is fragile even if it doesn't feel like it we can be prepared and be vigilant and hopeful if we're lucky our journey will go on for a long long time speaking of Journeys we want to address something in the spirit of transparency kazak has changed in the last 2 years we've become more than a YouTube channel or Animation studio and now also run a paper shop that sells hundreds of thousands of calendars posters and notebooks that's not a happy accident many of us have a background in graphic design paper products are Our Roots and we actually started out creating posters books and print infographics we love that you can touch them smell them nerd about small details and printing techniques just like the channel we started small and without great ambition step by step we found the right printers and papers learned about shipping and expanded our shop we put a huge amount of research love and hours into it because this is the only way we know how to do things we don't just want to make generic merch we want to make things that fit our mission of making science exciting and creating beautiful things things that persist and are made with high quality and love our shop gives us another Outlet to do this and as a nice side effect has turned into our main source of income for everything we do on this channel which also Keeps Us independent and our videos free for everyone so we want to build further on that and create more things that last we've just started a new notebook line called pocket log that will expand on in the future the first edition is a dinosaur themed collection that will hopefully serve a future paleontologist well there are loads of plans for sciency stuff more journals and calendars and infographics let us know what you would like us to make for your R Kids classrooms and yourself in the end the things we do work because you like them and because you enable us to put thousands of hours into videos and hundreds of hours into posters and journals thank you so much for that we're looking forward to making fun sciencec stuff for you no matter if it's a video a poster or something else entirely thank you for [Music] watching\", \"wrapping your mind around your life is pretty hard because you're up to your neck in it it's like trying to understand the ocean while learning how to swim on most days you're busy just keeping your head above water so it's not easy to figure out what to do with your life and how to spend your time there are a million distractions your family friends and romantic Partners boring work and exciting projects video games to play and books to read and then there's your couch that somebody needs to lie on it's easy to get lost so let's take a step back and look at your life from the [Music] outside the average KS Zar viewer is around 25 years old which is a pretty good time in the life of most people the insecurities of the teenage years have begun to recede Maybe you find yourself in a job or a long-term relationship maybe you've started a family or are working on an advanced degree maybe you're not doing any of that and still want to enjoy life whatever that means to you or maybe you feel stuck and don't know where to go yet about 1 in 20 people watching this video will get to live to 100 let's assume you are one of the lucky ones which means you had a total of 5,200 weeks of Life at your disposal when you were born you spent the first 600 weeks of your life being a kid and 400 being a teenager during this time you were pretty useless for Society and also not very free to make your own decisions as a payoff you were somewhat spared from the consequences and responsibilities of adulthood mostly because well-meaning adults protected You by cleaning up your mess and giving you time to find yourself this time is necessary to make you at least in theory a functioning human although most people probably don't feel like that after puberty in any case by the time you're 20 over 1,000 of your 5,200 weeks have passed depending on what you aspire to at this point you're either working already or have entered further education the amount of fun you can have in this phase of your life varies a lot if you pick up a trade or lead to work to support yourself or others the serious side of life begins earlier if you go to university you get to push back work life a bit longer in any case most people start working for real in their 20s at the latest which Begins the productive or potentially grindy or Soul crushing period of your life people tend to work until the age of 65 which means that you'll spend at least 2,000 weeks of your life with serious adult work hopefully in a job that makes you feel good and appreciated or that makes the world better this is such an important thing that we'll look at work and how you can try to find a satisfying career in another video this is the main block of life for most people the time when you might have kids and travel a bit and climb the career ladder and build a house may get divorced and fall in love again in this phase you transition from being young to middle-aged to Old not old old but the young old of your 60s at 65 you've used up 3,400 of your 5,200 weeks the last phase of your life begins if you've managed to acquire enough wealth to high in theory you're now free to do whatever you like for up to 1,800 weeks but of course this is not how it works for the majority of you watching this video 19 out of 20 people will not live to 100 the average lifespan in the US is 79 in Germany it's 81 in Japan 84 in Brazil it's 75 if you die at age 80 which is still not bad you only have 780 weeks of Freedom after you retire that's roughly as many weeks of Freedom as an old person as you spent as a child unfortunately disease and the tiredness of age trip you up here because with old age the human body begins to decline sharply for example the vast majority of cancer related deaths occur in people over 70 if you bet all your Fun Cards on being free and happy in your retirement you might be bitterly disappointed and all of this is still assuming things work out and and you even get to grow old you can drown in a pool at age 7 get cancer at age 32 die in a car crash at age 48 you can fall from a ladder at age 60 every day the universe rolls a bunch of dice for every human and every day someone somewhere on this planet rolls a critical failure and their life ends that day the older you get the more dice are rolled for you usually when you swim through the ocean that is your life you don't think about all of this too much and that's fine life is engaging Enough by itself and the future is this undefined weird thing but thinking about it from time to time is helpful in refocusing on what you want to do and to minimize regrets you will have when you look back and to remind you that if you don't use your time today you might not get a chance to use it tomorrow life is complicated and it's hard to make decisions between all the things and people that are important to you this has become painfully obvious to billions of people during the Corona virus pandemic if you respected social distancing so many things that we took for granted were not available anymore traveling and public places and eating out and seeing friends and meeting new people spending time together became limited and precious but actually the time you have with the people you love is already precious think of your parents as a child you spend basically every day with them your your time spent together begins to decline as you transition and become a teenager and fight to develop your own identity but as teenagers you probably still see them regularly which changes as you enter your 20s when most people move out for University for work or just to be on their own if you're making an effort to be with your parents for two full weeks each year for the rest of their lives which covers the main holidays birthdays and a bit extra you still have already spent more than 90% of the time you will ever spend with them even if they grow pretty old if they die earlier or if you see them only a few days each year this number shrinks even more so in all likelihood the vast majority of time you will ever spend with your parents has passed the same holds true for your siblings or old friends that moved to the other side of the country you're at the tail end of the time with some of the most important people in your life one day you will see them for the last time and it's actually the same with everything else the concept of doing something for the last time feels Eerie like something that you should only experience when you're on death row or extremely old or something like that but it happens all the time is there a Hobby you've been lazy about for a long time maybe you still have those Warhammer Minis that you wanted to paint did you always want to revisit that place where you had an amazing time a decade ago is there someone you wanted to reach out to for a long time but haven't yet or or pick up that sport again to meet new friends maybe you will never do any of these things again because life gets in the way and at some point it's too late as the global pandemic begins to wind down we will all soon be able to be with each other again and do fun things together it's never a bad time to reach out to a friend or a potential friend and let them know that you're looking forward to hanging out but no matter when you're watching this our life is an Incredible Gift and there are so many fun engaging and fulfilling things to do and you get to decide what and who matters to you but what matters the most is that you actually make decisions from time to [Music] time this video was based on and inspired by an article by our friend Tim Urban of way but why the best blog on the internet be sure to check it out to get more New Perspectives on things also if you want to reminder about the things we still want to do in life with Tim's permission we created a qutar version of the calendar of your life that lets you track how many weeks of your life you've spent already and how many you have left you can also color in the weeks to keep track of exactly how you're spending them if you're just looking for a visual reminder to put things in perspective we've made a timeline of your life it's printed in vibrant neon colors on high quality paper and will look great as an artpiece on your wall like all of our products these posters were designed with love and produced with Care by us here at Kazar getting something from our shop is the best way to support our Channel while getting something beautiful in return because of you we can keep making elaborate videos like the one you just watched and release them for free for everyone thank you so much for your support [Music]\", \"is there a border we will never cross are there places we will never reach no matter how hard we try it turns out there are even with sci-fi technology we are trapped in a limited pocket of the universe and the finite stuff within it how much universe is there for us and how far can we [Music] go if you look at the night sky you might assume it will be there forever stars born and die again in a cycle that feels endless but it's not take the Milky Way up to 200,000 light years in diameter containing some 100 to 400 billion stars how many stars do you think are born here each year thousands millions the answer is around three three new stars per year 95% of all the stars that will ever exist in the universe have already been born and we live at The Tail End of the Age of star formation we are at the beginning of the end of the universe as we know it the formation of new stars will continue to slow down but there's more it turns out that the universe is rushing away from us the Milky Way Is Not Alone Together with the Andromeda galaxy and more than 50 dwarf galaxies it forms the local group a region of space about 10 million light years in diameter our Galactic neighborhood hundreds of Galaxy groups like The Local group make up the lanaka supercluster which itself is only one of a myriad of superclusters in total there are around 2 trillion galaxies that make up the current observable universe unfortunately even if we could travel at light speed around 94% of the galaxies we can see are already unridable for us forever let this number sink in for a moment the simple fact that there's a limit for us and that there is so much universe that a human will never be able to touch is kind of frightening why are all of these galaxies Out Of Reach already well it all has to do with why there are galaxies in the first place the Big Bang we're simplifying here but in a nutshell about 10 the^ ofus 36 seconds after the big bang the young universe was a very small bubble of energy it wasn't completely uniform though some parts of it were a tiny tiny bit denser than others which had massive consequences in a process called Cosmic inflation the observable universe expanded rapidly from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometers in a trillionth of a second that was so fast that all those tiny differences in density were stretched from subatomic distances into Galactic distances which is why the whole universe consists of more and less dense regions pockets of the universe filled with a bit more stuff than the space around them after that short but powerful inflation ended gravity began trying to pull everything back together inside the denser Pockets gravity emerged Victorious and so over time they grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today the local group is our pocket of the universe but at larger scales outside the denser pocket the expansion of space never stopped this means that our local group is surrounded by a lot of stuff but none of those structures and galaxies are gravitationally bound to us the more the universe expands the larger the distance between us and the other gravitational Pockets becomes even worse for us the expansion of the universe is accelerating we don't know why this happens so we came up with the concept of dark energy you can imagine it like an invisible effect that speeds up the expansion of the universe we'll explain these Concepts in more detail in another video though for now all you need to know is that the universe is expanding faster and faster this expansion means that there's a cosmological horizon around us everything Beyond it is traveling faster relative to us than the speed of light so everything that passes The Horizon is irretrievably Out Of Reach forever and we will never be able to interact with it again in a sense it's like a black hole's Event Horizon but all around us 94% of the galaxies we can see today have already pass it and are lost to us forever wait if we can't interact with them how come we can still see them well the way we're able to see something is via light and although the speed of light is the fastest way to travel through the universe it needs time to get from one place to another every second Light reaches us from trillions of galaxies that have passed the Horizon because when their light was emitted they were much closer to us we are looking at their ancient past and see their ancient positions so the observable universe is much larger than the universe we can actually interact with in a sense the universe is pulling off a great show for us showing us things that are Out Of Reach forever we have no idea what these galaxies look like today and we will never know but we will be able to observe them for a long time as their light H our telescopes interestingly this means that currently the observable universe still appears to be growing as more and more Light released by super distant galaxies billions of years ago is arriving at our doorsteps still all the pockets of the universe outside the local group will one day pass our cosmological Horizon once they do their light won't be able to reach us anymore and from our perspective they will fade away Into Darkness every second of your life 60,000 Stars pass the Horizon since you started watching this video around 22 million stars have moved out of our reach forever okay but if 94% of the observable universe is beyond the cosmic Horizon and gone forever that still leaves us with 6% that is technically in reach which is still a ton of stuff all the Galaxy Pockets that are less than 18 billion light years away they are still moving away but slow enough that we could physically reach them although the chances are shrinking with every second that passes everything that's more than around 5 million light years away is moving away from us but the closest galaxy groups are receding the slowest so there is a Time window to jump Galaxy groups the challenge is Extreme though even for type three civilizations even at the speed of light a trip to the Mafi group the closest pocket of galaxies outside the local group would take 11 million years if some sort of super motivated super Advanced civilization takes this Challenge on its potential sphere of influence could expand to hundreds or thousands of galaxies although as time passes and the universe grows they would be separated forever it's pretty safe to assume that humans will not make this journey at least not with technologies that are even remotely on the horizon for us the local group is most likely the largest structure that we will ever be a part of just traveling between the Stars would be an achievement of Epic Proportions we would already be incredibly successful if we were to colonize our Cosmic backyard which accounts for 0.000000 00000000000000 1% of the observable universe as dark energy pushes the rest of the universe away from us the local group will become more tightly bound all its galaxies big and small will merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name mil dromeda in a few billion years this process might even smash huge gas clouds together and respark star formation for some time and this new light will be very welcome because at some point the Galaxy's outside milk dromeda will be so far away that they become too faint to detect once this happens no information outside of the local group will reach us ever again the universe will recede from view a being born in the far future in mil dromeda will think that the Universe consists of nothing but its own Galaxy when they look far into empty space they will only see more emptiness and darkness they won't see cosmic background radiation and they won't be able to learn about the Big Bang they may have no way of knowing what we know today the nature of the expanding Universe when it began and how it will end they might think the universe is static and eternal milk dromeda will be an island in the darkness slowly getting darker and darker still with its trillion Stars the local group is certainly a big enough playground to entertain Humanity for a while after all we still haven't figured out how to leave our solar system and we have dozens of billions of years at the very least to explore our galaxy and we have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time to see not only our future but also our most distant past just by looking into the night sky as isolated as the local group is it is our home and it really is a spectacular Place time for some behind the scenes content you might have noticed that we sorta already made this video a few years ago but the original had a regrettable mistake in it we said it would be physically impossible to ever leave the local group to reach other Galaxy groups but our travel limit is actually much larger as we showed in this video it's not physically impossible to go further but just extremely unlikely that it'll ever happen so why did we leave the video up well it has to do with the nature of the mistake we talked to astrophysicists and they thought it didn't matter the parts they considered important were correct and they thought we should just leave it and move on so with that feedback we decided to spare the video but since 2016 and ready thanks to you BS we were able to grow ksar and add fact Checkers to the team and develop an in-depth process with experts and our detailed sources documents to avoid these sorts of mistakes and also to make our work transparent we can't avoid making mistakes from time to time but we can work hard on getting better and this video kept bugging us so we finally decided to replace it not just re-upload but remake it better and longer and add fun universe facts to make it worthwhile sorry for taking so long we'll leave the old video up but p a comment and change the title if you want to support us and our sometimes exhausting but hopefully worthwhile methods you can watch share and click the Bell and get something from our shop inspired by this video's topic we created a Milky Way poster and a local group poster and we're working on a series about the entire universe visit our shop for more sciencey and K gakti products designed with love and produced with care in any case thank you for watching [Music] wait\", \"black holes are the most powerful and extreme things in the universe and they're wildly weird and complicated what would happen if you fell inside one and what are they [Music] really first we need to talk about space and time space and time are the grand stage where the play of the universe unfolds but space isn't a fixed stage and time doesn't tick the same for everyone everywhere in short they're relative matter bends space and bent space tells matter how to move put some stars and planets on the stage and it sacks underneath them that misshapen stage with all its little warps and dips gives us gravity black holes do not just bend the stage they're like trap doors places with so much mass that the Universe formed a noggo Zone where the rules change most black holes form when very massive stars die we explained this process in detail in our neutron star video all you need to know now is that in the final moments of really massive stars their insides implode at nearly a quarter of the speed of light this packs so much mass so close together creating something so dense that it's sort of breaks the stage of the universe a black hole with 10 times the mass of the Sun would be barely 60 km across if you look directly at a black hole it looks like nothing the space under their control is blocked by an invisible oneway border called The Event Horizon The Event Horizon forms a shell around a region of space that once entered is shielded from the rest of the universe forever because the black hole trapo form space so much not even light can escape it and with nothing escaping to transfer information from the inside it's impossible to tell what it really looks like we can still observe black holes because of their effect on matter things can orbit black holes just as they can orbit the Sun or a planet many black holes have discs of matter orbiting outside the Event Horizon this matter can become incredibly hot as close orbits can speed this matter up to half the speed of light and tiny amounts of friction and collisions between particles heat them to a billion deg making the space around these black holes ironically incredibly bright what would happen if you were to try to get close or even inside a black hole first of all you'd see the strangest funhouse mirror in the universe mattera isn't the only thing orbiting a black hole gravity is so strong near them that light can orbit too if you hover just outside the event vent Horizon at the photon sphere in any direction you just see yourself Straight Ahead would be the back of your own head as light from your back travels around the black hole to your eyes gravity also Alters the passage of time itself the stronger the gravity the slower time passes while you watch the universe above you speed up those far away will watch you in slow motion if you chose to fly away from the black hole you might find that eons have passed for the rest of the universe a freakish one-way time travel trip to the Future where your loved ones are long dead but getting close to a black hole can be incredibly dangerous a painful death by spaghettification awaits you because your feet are closer to the black hole than your head they feel a stronger pull of gravity enough to pull you apart as you descend it gets worse the pulling gets stronger your body squeezed thinner and straighter until you've been reduced to a thin stream of hot plasma gobbled up in one final slurp never to be seen again spaghettification is only a risk with smaller black holes since they have much smaller radi ey if you go to the center of a galaxy and find a super massive black hole you might be able to experience crossing the Event Horizon as you approach The Event Horizon a distant Observer would think they never saw you enter it seeing you stop and fade the last Light you emit trickling up and out away from the event vent Horizon meanwhile from your perspective the void of the black hole Rises up to meet you as lights from fewer directions can reach you the Blackness envelops you until your only view of the universe you left is a tiny spot of light here inside the Event Horizon space and time are so horribly broken the real time travel is possible so it's probably a good thing that nothing gets out if anything could Escape it could create all sorts of time travel paradoxes and issues that break the universe as scary as the Event Horizon is it keeps us safe from that drama whether you have survived this long doesn't really matter as now there's only the certainty of crushing death in your near future inside the Event Horizon SpaceTime itself is so bent and warped that whatever Direction you move here every forward you go leads only towards the center of the black hole trying to go in any direction only brings you to the center faster to survive the longest you must do nothing in the center of the black hole we find the singularity a single point with all the matter that has ever crossed the Event Horizon all crushed to a point infinitely small there is no memory of the things that made it as stuff disappears down the black hole trapo Forever The Singularity makes all things equal this actually breaks the universe in really cool ways we've made a video about this problem if you want to learn more but in a nutshell everything that comes too close becomes black hole matter concentrated at the singularity this lack of a memory of its past means that a black hole has only three properties its mass Spin and electric charge everything else is lost they're a lot like fundamental particles in that respect this actually means that every single black hole in the universe is the same sure their mass is different and some spin faster than others but if we were to put all the singularities into a magical physics Museum they'd be identical like electrons but just like fundamental particles the properties of singularities are the best ways we can describe them on paper rather than an accurate representation of reality our current theories about the universe namely general relativity are just not able to describe or explain them the curvature of space becomes infinite density becomes infinite and our rules just don't make sense The Singularity has no surface or size something like a divide by Z era in the universe so singularities might not even exist or be completely different things but this is all we know right now from the best prediction we have from our best current theory of SpaceTime also basically everything you've ever heard about black holes even in this video is about theoretical black holes that aren't spinning because their maths is so much much easier but since black holes were born from dying stars that were spinning extremely quickly in their final moments as far as we know all black holes in the universe should be spinning right now at incredible speeds too up to 90% of the speed of light this means that in reality black holes are even more screwed up than they usually get credit for the singularities of rotating black holes are even Wilder the rotation causes them to swell outwards into a sort of ring this rotation is so powerful that space itself is dragged along this creates another region around spinning black holes called the ergosphere where it's impossible to stay still no matter how hard you try like a rushing Whirlpool of SpaceTime The Tide Is irresistible and the black hole makes you orbited whether you want to or not okay so what will happen to black holes as the universe ages and dies around them again we don't know but we have some ideas based on our current understanding of physics Hawking radiation in Quantum field Theory the vacuum of space is boiling with Quantum fluctuations these fluctuations are creating matter and antimatter pairs of particles from nothing which only exist for a very short time before annihilating when this happens near the Event Horizon of a black hole one of these particles can fall in stopping them from annihilating the escaping particle is hawking radiation ultimately the mass of this particle must come from the black hole so over eons black holes will shrink and radiate away Hawking radiation is not the stuff that fell into the black hole it's new stuff stealing Mass from it as the black hole shrinks the Hawking radiation gets stronger faster and faster until what's left eventually evaporates in a flash of high energy radiation like a nuclear bomb and then nothing but that won't happen for a long long time a black hole with the mass of our sun has a lifetime of 10 to the power of 67 years which means that it would take 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.00001% of its mass but most black holes are way more massive than our sun the most massive super massive black holes in the centers of galaxy have lifetimes of 10 to the power of 100 years how long is that imagine an hourglass filled with one grain of sand for every single particle in the universe every 10 billion years one single grain of sand falls to the bottom if we waited for all the sand to fall down not even 1% of the lifetimes of these black holes would have passed there is no good concept to help our brains grasp these time scales will we ever truly understand black holes really know what's going on inside them no one knows we can only see their outsides and the theories we have probably get their insides wrong but it's okay to not know everything it just means there's still work to be done it means there are still Mysteries to solve and Big Ideas to think about which is why humans do science in the end we can at least be sure that we still have plenty of time left to think about them before the last one melts away if you want to continue thinking about black holes you can do so by getting one of the many black hole related things the ksun team has made with love like

[Music]\", \"do we need nuclear energy to stop climate change more and more voices from science environmental activists and the Press have been saying so in recent years but this comes as a shock to those who are fighting against nuclear energy and the problems that come with it so who's right well it's complicated to slow rapid climate change the world needs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions to Net Zero in 2018 3 of global emissions were released through energy production namely by burning fossil fuels energy is a broad term that describes all sorts of stuff from moving things and people around to putting things big and small together or heating our homes currently 84% of the world's primary energy comes from fossil fuels 33% from oil 27% from coal and 24% from gas around 10% of the global oil supply is just used to burn in boilers to make our homes cozy and warm only about 16% of global energy is from low emission sources almost 7% from hydroelectric 5% from solar wind bioenergy wave tidal and geothermal combined and about 4% from nuclear so we pretty much rely on coal oil and gas to keep our civilization going which means it's actually very hard to transition away from them to have a chance of escaping fossil fuels without throwing Humanity back into the Stone Age one of the most impactful things we can do is to Electrify as many sectors as possible electricity is the stuff that appears like magic when you plug something into a socket so you can watch YouTube Every industry that can switch from burning fossil fuels to electricity needs to do so from electric cars to electric heaters why do we need to bet so hard on electricity because we can prod produce electricity with low emission Technologies like solar wind or Nuclear So electricity is a real lever for a radical transition but there are a few problems making this transition really hard first of all in most places in the world electricity is still generated mostly by burning fossil fuels and not only that in the last 20 years the world's electricity usage increased 73% in absolute terms while we are installing Renewables at record speeds at the same time the amount of fossil fuel we're burning for electricity still keeps Rising year by year Renewables have so far not been able to catch up with the demand for new electricity and so despite our progress emissions from electricity are still Rising worldwide the other alternative to fossil fuels is nuclear and even though it's not renewable its greenhouse gas emissions are tiny compared to burning stuff but in the last 20 years nuclear has basically stagnated countries like China India and South Korea built new reactors while Germany and Japan have been actively taking their nuclear plants offline which seems a bit weird if we look at the countries with the most low carbon electricity in the world that get most of their juice mainly from two sources nuclear or hydrop power take France and Sweden in France only around 10% comes from fossil fuel fuels while 67% comes from nuclear and 23% from Renewables primarily Hydro in Sweden almost 30% comes from nuclear power and about 45% from Hydro so we know that nuclear energy can work at scale on the technical side because of the lack of investment and innovation in the last few decades the majority of the world's nuclear reactors are pretty old technology that's very costly to replace in most Western countries build in nuclear reactors has become very expensive for a variety of reasons like a loss of knoow in constructing them policy changes and increased regulatory constraints so it can take a decade or longer just to finish a power plant in contrast countries like South Korea China India and Russia are able to build new nuclear reactors comparatively quickly and at a competitive cost still generally in the west the current generation of nuclear power plants are more expensive to build and maintain than most most fossil fuel Alternatives there are also the concerns about nuclear waste and the fear of accidents but we cover those in other videos in more detail we have designs for nuclear reactors that solve many of their problems namely small reactors that take less time and money to get started there are also next Generation technologies that can already turn radioactive waste into new fuel but so far these have not been deployed at a scale where they can have a significant impact on the nuclear SE considering these uncertainties some argue that nuclear power is a dangerous relic of the past and that we should just let it go and focus on Renewables but while Renewables undoubtedly are the future of electricity they still have their own huge challenges to overcome before they can take over the vast majority of the electricity gr the main problem is reliability and consistency it's not always windy and the sun doesn't always shine especially in the morning and evenings when humans need the most electricity the variations between Seasons don't make this issue easier to make Renewables reliable and not risk blackouts we need massive storage capacities where we can save energy collected when the sun or wind are at their Peak and release it later when we actually need it until this is possible other sources of electricity need to provide a controllable load that creates the reliability of Supply that our civilization needs to run properly eventually we will be able to do this with Renewables but we need a lot of batteries or storage power plants right now we simply don't have the tech and the capacities to make this transition fast enough to replace fossil fuels but even if we could there's another aspect we have to take into account we're not just trying to kick fossil fuels out of electricity we're trying to replace energy with electricity if we're going to to Electrify sectors that currently use fossil fuels like cars or heating we will need significantly more electricity than we're currently using everywhere around the world and if the electricity needs of the world population continue to grow as they have over the last 20 years we'll need even more it all comes down to one thing no energy source is perfect all have their own unique problems both Renewables and nuclear energy require time investment and technological Innovation on their own neither is ready to remove fossil fuels from our electricity grit although activists on both sides claim that they are in the end the question is how we want to deal with all these challenges should we give up nuclear immediately and at least temporarily accept higher emissions will we try to extend the life of current nuclear reactors and shut them down afterwards while solving the shortcomings of Renewables or will we invest in new nuclear technology to get new nuclear reactor types that are cheaper and safer or will we maybe do both opinion part starts here considering the risks the climate change poses for the biosphere and Humanity any technology that has a chance of contributing to a solution should be pursued that's just good risk management and strategy if preventing rapid climate change as quickly as possible is our goal it might be a good idea to see nuclear and Renewables not as opponents but as partners we know there's no time to waste so we should keep all of our low emission players on the field as things are both nuclear and Renewables need Innovation and investment but if we don't know yet which technology will be ready how quickly why not just invest in both and see what happens and on the topic of current capacities if we take nuclear energy offline right now then that missing capacity will be replaced at least partially by fossil fuels even if new nuclear power plants in the west are expensive in the long run it may be cheaper to build them as long as they prevent more fossil fuel capacity being added and paying for the consequences of Rapid climate change so do we need nuclear energy well it really depends how hard we choose to make things for ourselves and in a world that's already having a really hard time quitting fossil fuels why why should we make things harder than necessary\", \"Here in the Kodkach labs, we only work on the most important scientific problems. Like, what if we nuke stuff? Or how about we make this elephant explode? Or who could forget, look at this thing. It's really big. Continuing this proud tradition, let's explore the scientific mystery of what would happen to you if Earth suddenly turned into gold. The Midas Apocalypse based on the ancient tale of King Midas who was cursed so everything he touched turned into gold. Before we can explore this scenario with science, we'll first define the premise. Midas' curse is a very special phenomenon called magic which allows us to modify physics. So what happens when Midas touches something and it turns to gold? [Music] An atom of gold has 79 protons and 118 neutrons in its nucleus. The electric force of the protons on the electrons around them shapes the atom and gives gold its chemical properties like that it doesn't rust and that it's kind of shiny and bendy. So to make not gold into gold, we have to change atoms. Let's say Midas touches a duck. All the light elements like hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen gain electrons and protons and neutrons to become gold. Not only is the duck suddenly 33 times more massive, it's also much too dense. The gold atoms are far closer together than they like and repel each other violently, causing the golden duck to explode with the energy of half a ton of TNT, leaving only gold dust and a very dead Midas. This is clearly not a very good way for Midas' power to work. So what if instead Midas' power uses the atoms that are already present and simply rearranges all particles in the matter he touches into gold? No matter is created or destroyed. Instead, atoms dissolve and the protons, neutrons, and electrons are reassembled to make gold. However, gold is very dense, about 20 times denser than a duck. Without adding any matter, the gold duck would be a very awkward kind of foamy gold with lots of tiny microscopic gaps. This is funky and doesn't explode, which is progress. Now that we've established a sort of magic that works, what would happen if Midas stumbles? What if he touches Earth itself? Let's freeze time for just a moment and rearrange all the matter in the Earth. Just like the duck, the Earth is now solid gold, but with many tiny atomic scale gaps. While these gaps weren't a huge deal for the duck, they're a big problem for the Earth. A spongy planet is not a thing that can exist as gravity compresses Earth, squeezing it together to close up the gaps. As a result, the Earth contracts, shrinking to 2/3 of its radius. If you're standing on Earth's surface, you'll suddenly find yourself in freefall, like on a roller coaster, as the ground sinks away beneath you. But since the ground is falling, too, it doesn't move away from you. It feels like someone turned off gravity, and you and everything else would begin to float. But the ride doesn't last forever. It takes only 10 minutes for everything to crash down. And a weird 10 minutes it is indeed. And then, as abruptly as it started, it stops. The collapsing Earth has reached its desired size and gravity is suddenly turned back on for you. Hopefully, you enjoyed your minutes of floating because the ground and you with it crash into the planet at 30,000 km an hour, making your body splatter like a water balloon as it hits. In one instant, basically all of humanity gets smashed into red puddles. This is only the start of our problems, though, since Earth imploded supersonically. The kinetic energy of the implosion is basically equivalent to detonating a planet made of TNT. Crushed together under incredible forces, Earth's core reaches a million° C, a temperature closer to the core of a star than anything we're used to finding on Earth. As the Earth crashes into itself, it generates an enormously powerful shock wave which plows upwards, catapulting the atmosphere up and off. The Earth's surface temperature reaches hundreds of thousands of degrees, and everything on it is instantly vaporized to a fluffy plasma cloud that starts to expand, but not by much. Many of the atoms that may have been new get mixed into this cloud, while others boil off, escaping from the atmosphere. The golden plasma outshines the sun, while the enormous radiation lifts tons of material off into space. Over the coming days, the plasma cloud cools and eventually freezes into a shiny little golden ball. Okay, maybe this type of magic doesn't work. So, if replacing atoms made the Earth so overdense that it exploded and disassembling and reassembling atoms made the Earth so under dense that it imploded, there must be a sweet spot where the Earth does neither. What if Midas' power is such that an object is suddenly replaced by an object with the same volume made from solid gold? That magic is a little bit more magic and cuts a few extra corners. But let's see where this leads us. So, Midas stumbles again. Even though our new pure gold earth is not expanding or contracting, it's suddenly much more massive. The density of gold is 3 and 1/2 times greater than the Earth. Meaning the Earth is going to get 3 and 1/2 times more massive. For starters, everyone now has to contend with surface gravity that is more than three times stronger. So, if you're not a champion weightlifter who's used to carrying around a few times your body weight on your shoulders, you're probably going to be slammed to the ground by your own weight. Depending on where you were when Earth turned into gold, this alone could seriously hurt or even kill you. Trees and artificial structures collapse under stress they were never meant to sustain, while birds and planes and all things that were able to fly or float splash to the ground all around you. And you're not the only thing weighed down by the greater gravity. The weight of the atmosphere and also atmospheric pressure nearly quadruples, which is a bad thing if you like living. On its own, this won't kill you. Scuba divers can comfortably breathe air at these pressures for a while. But unfortunately, squeezing the atmosphere this much raises its temperature to 150° C, which is like the insides of an oven. The entire Earth's surface bakes, roasting anything and everything. There is no escape. Gold may be a metal, but it's about three times weaker than steel and also very malleable, which makes it very bad mountain material. The tallest mountains that can be supported are now only about 2 km high. So, whole ranges compress as their own weight basically crushes their base. It's hard to say what happens here. We're probably in for giant earthquakes and landslides as the planet is squeezed into a new shape. And it's not just mountain ranges. The differences between the continents and the ocean floor level out, causing the ocean basins to overflow, sending massive tidal waves over the Earth's surface. What remains is a planet made of gold, entirely covered by an ocean 3 km deep, a super hot atmosphere, and a lot of dead people. Hm. Okay, there may be a lesson to take away here, but we're not sure what it is. We did all the maths, though. It's in our sources document if you want to take a look. If you learned anything in this video, let us know what it was. So, as you might know, the things we sell in our shop are the reason we're able to publish videos for free. But it's way more than that for us. Here's a short story and a making off. A while ago, we posted this image on social media just to post something nicel looking. Immediately, a lot of people were quite upset about it because it was wrong and you guys take what we put out that seriously. So, we deleted it and contacted experts to make something new and better. We spent hundreds of hours on research and illustration and created this new extensive map of evolution, a new visualization of the relationships between living things that didn't exist before. And while this was obviously a lot of work and stress, it sort of exemplifies why working on this channel is so satisfying. because you people care and this makes us work harder and learn things we didn't know before. So, thank you for supporting our crazy ideas and our sometimes crazy merch. Because of you, we can continue to release our videos for free for everyone and drop hundreds of hours into new concepts. We are super grateful for that. You can check out the new evolution poster among many other things made with love in our shop. Wait. [Music]\", \"nuclear energy creates an uneasy feeling of danger for many people ancient and dangerous minerals are concentrated to awaken seemingly unnatural Powers creating horribly toxic elements that if they escape can and have killed people in horrible ways how many people has nuclear energy killed and [Music] how nuclear energy has been a thing since 19 51 and since then there have been around 30 reported accidents globally most of them were pretty minor compared to the two disasters everybody is familiar with Fukushima and Chernobyl Chernobyl is undoubtedly the worst nuclear accident in history for a number of reasons the reactor technology was old and Ill prepared for emergencies and the government response was slow and more concerned about image than damage control still only 31 people died directly in the accident but what makes nuclear energy scary is not reactors blowing up but the radiation they release so the real question is how many deaths through cancer and other diseases will chernobil cause here things get really complicated because you dip right into controversy and just discussing the different estimates and how they were calculated deserves a video of its own the most pessimistic estimate comes from a study commissioned by the European green party and projects up to 60,000 premature deaths by the year 2065 most scientific studies come up with numbers much lower than this the wh has estimated that in total the long-term death toll will be around 4,000 while the UN scientific committee on the effects of atomic radiation concluded that even this figure could be too high for more details on this check our research document the second big nuclear accident was Fukushima daichi in 2011 Fukushima did not only operate with much better technology that was less dangerous in the first place much better security measures were in place and the official response was fast and decisive and so the current death toll is only 573 the major difference here is that these deaths were not a consequence of radiation they were indirect deaths from the stress of the evacuation of the areas around the reactors and occurred almost entirely in older populations estimates of the possible long-term deaths from radiation vary WI from none at all to about 1,000 in terms of the other long-term consequences an increase in thyroid cancer in children has been observed but according to the who this is related to The increased screening rate by 2018 there had been only one confirmed death among workers as a result of radiation induced lung cancer now let's compare this to renewable energy solar wind and geothermal energy basically only cause deaths as a result of construction and maintenance accidents unfortunately their current share of global energy is pretty low the major player in renewable energy is hydrop power which mostly means building dams and letting water flow through turbines from a higher elevation to a lower elevation in total Hydro has been the most fatal in terms of accidents with hundreds of thousands of deaths in the last half century one accident clearly stands out the 1975 Banga hydroelectric Dam failure in China which has striking similarities to chobble Old technology poor design and poor management by authoritarian governments concerned about appearances in a nutshell a massive typhoon triggered intense flooding the destroyed the dam and subsequently a number of smaller dams in a chain reaction unleashing a flood of over 15 billion cubic M of water in total kilometer wide waves as high as buildings devastated thousands of square km of Countryside and countless communities all in all the death toll from just this one accident and its direct consequences is estimated to lie between 85,000 to 240,000 but all of these deaths caused by nuclear and renewable energy are actually negligible in comparison to the real killer energy source fossil fuel the most widely used source of energy and electricity when we burn fossil fuels to heat up water and make turbines spin or to cause mini explosions to move cars with internal combustion engines gases like ozone sulfur dioxide carbon monoxide and nitrogen dioxide are released into the atmosphere breathing in these gases disrupts lung function which aggravates chronic conditions like asthma and bronchitis and causes a wide range of respiratory and cardiovascular diseases but even more dangerous is the fine particle pollution burning fossil fuels causes a mixture of solid and liquid droplets of poisonous substances as small as 2.5 microns in diameter they easily find their way deep into your lungs and increase the risk of deadly diseases like lung cancer stroke and heart disease fossil fuel related air pollution is the number one cause of environmental related deaths in the world according to the who it accounts for 29% of all cases of lung cancer 177% of deaths from acute lower respiratory infection 24% from stroke 25% from ES schic heart disease and 43% from chronic obstructive pulmonary disease all in all outside air pollution adds up to the deaths of 4 million people each year what makes air pollution especially problematic and Sinister is the fact that the damage it causes happens very gradually which makes it hard for our brains that didn't evolve with subtle dangers in mind to realize the scope of the problem collectively air pollution from fossil fuels is estimated to have have killed around 100 million people in the past 50 years but wait is that really fair fossil fuels also provide over 80% of global energy so it makes sense that they cause the most deaths so let's compare deaths per energy unit deaths per energy unit produced a few Studies have compared the death rates from different energy sources per 1 tatt hour that's about the annual energy consumption of 2017 ,000 EU citizens or 12,600 US citizens to produce that much energy for one year coal causes 25 deaths oil causes 18 and natural gas three renewable energy causes one death every few decades and nuclear in the worst case nuclear energy would cause one death every 14 years one study even found that nuclear energy actually saved 2 million lives between 1971 and 2009 but by displacing fossil fuels from the global Energy Mix the numbers are clear even when using wildly pessimistic numbers nuclear energy is among the safest forms of energy generation and at a time when we're struggling to slow down rapid climate change it's a really valuable low carbon option however all these facts still leave one major argument that is fielded against nuclear power opponents of nuclear energy argue that nuclear waste and its lack of long-term storage solutions is an unacceptable problem and risk while proponents of nuclear energy say that until renewable energies are able to cover the complete energy demands of mankind it's arguably safer to store nuclear waste for the time being than to inhale poisonous gases and promote rapid climate change but a detailed discussion about nuclear waste would go too far here more about it in our sources let us know if you'd like a whole video about it so looking at the comparative death rates it's a bit concerning that some countries are replacing nuclear energy with fossil fuels mostly coal especially Germany and Japan have been the most active in dismantling their nuclear Fleet in aoy to appease the public the German government shut down 11 of its 17 nuclear facilities and plans to close the remaining reactors in 2022 the immediate Gap in energy production was filled by temporarily increasing coal production the energy source with the largest Health impacts and the worst con quences for climate change a 2019 analysis concluded that as a consequence the nuclear phase out has led to 1,100 avoidable deaths per year in Germany due to the increased air pollution in the years after 2010 so in conclusion nuclear energy feels way more dangerous than it actually is no matter how you look at it the one thing we should strive to get rid of as quickly as possible of fossil fuels to prevent the deaths they cause each year and to slow down climate CL change regardless of how much you personally care about climate change issues or which energy source you favor saving millions of lives should be something we can all agree on\", \"what would happen if we were to detonate a very very powerful nuclear weapon on the moon would the explosion knock its orbit towards Earth causing tidal waves and misery could the moon be destroyed showering the Earth in a rain of meteoric [Music] death during the Cold War the moon was a major Target for space exploration and you know military bases so the US Air Force commissioned a serious study into the effects of a nuclear detonation on the surface of the Moon but just quoting stuff is boring so let's conduct a very important scientific experiment with an imaginary 100 Megaton thermonuclear Warhead about twice as powerful as the most powerful bomb ever detonated we'll also place a number of curious astronauts around the Moon as observers let's push the button and slow down time for the first few milliseconds nothing much happens outside our weapon meanwhile inside High explosives send a shock wave to a radioactive metal core compressing it so much that it reaches criticality and starts a nuclear fishing Chain Reaction the 100 million Dee plasma created in this first stage sets off the second stage with atomic nuclei fusing like they do in the core of a star very briefly our weapon contains one of the the hottest places in the universe and only now barely 10 milliseconds later does the rest of the universe find out that anything has happened as suddenly the bomb dissolves and a flaming star of nuclear death is born so far so good but everything that happens now is very different from what we're used to on Earth because of one major difference there's no atmosphere as the fireball shines it releases a flash of X-rays and thermal photons a wave of silent heat which rushes outwards in all directions on Earth this heat would Char and burn everything within a 50 km radius at least but on the moon without an atmosphere and oxygen rich air there's no burning at all also there are no things to burn the crunchy top soil of the moon is made from silicate Rock and metals chewed to dust by eons of meteorite impacts mixed with tiny traces of water when heated by the explosion x-rays from the fireball vaporize a thin cloud of Rock from the lunar surface while the Unlucky dust that's inside the fireball melts into glass any astronauts watching the show within about 50 km can expect to be fried and now we begin to see one of the biggest differences between explosions in space and on Earth on Earth the atmosphere fights back against the plasma bubble its expansion is violently stopped within Moments by the pressure of the atmosphere but this is not good news as the fireball Rams the atmosphere it it produces the most destructive part of a nuclear explosion on Earth the shock wave compressed air around the explosion rushes out faster than the speed of sound shattering buildings and roaring so loud it ruptures organs but on the moon there is no shock wave no atmosphere means nothing to impede the expanding explosion in space on the moon the fireball just grows in Airy silence as there's no atmosphere to stop it or to give it a voice this would be an amazing thing to watch from a safe distance unfortunately there's hardly any safe viewing distance for a nuclear explosion on the moon without an atmosphere weakening the deadly ionizing radiation that can scramble DNA anyone close enough to get a good look will be exposed to fatal amounts of radiation but of course that's not all while all of this happens the explosion hammers against the moon transferring about a tenth of the explosion energy into seismic waves powering an intense moonquake the Moon is much smaller than the Earth and our astronauts will feel an inescapable violent shaking no matter where they're standing comparable to an earthquake of seven on the r to scale this shaking could seriously damage or even level infrastructure we might have built anywhere on the moon those who hit on The Far Side of the Moon would have no idea it was an exposion the quaking would feel like an asteroid the size of the Great Pyramid had struck and it's not over yet where our bomb explodes the ground splatters like water when a rock strikes a pond as the explosion pushes against the surface it may excavate as much as 100 million cubic M of dust and rock forming a crater a km across while Bedrock is pulverized to Rubble debris is shot into the sky in every direction again without an atmosphere there's no drag to slow any of it down much of the debris scattered never returns to the Moon flying off faster than escape velocity a flurry of microm meteorites have been cast off to explore or the solar system many of which will rain down on the earth though few will be larger than Pebbles any satellite astronaut or space station in the way though will have a really bad time microm meteorites are launched at many speeds and angles allowing them to spread all over the surface of the Moon like bullets they'll punch through our curious astronauts no matter where they stand finally our explosion comes to an end on Earth the fireball Rises like a hot a balloon forming a sort of stalk as it reaches up cooler air is drawn in around it rounding the top into a mushroom cloud but on the moon well you know by now no atmosphere no mushroom the larger the plasma gets the cooler it becomes and the less energy it has to make interesting or terrifying things happen within seconds of pulling the trigger the bubble reddens and Fades from view it would be visible from the earth like a star flickering to life only to fade out right away a spark and then nothing as The Cloud of tiny debris reaches far above the surface of the Moon it's illuminated by the Sun for a few minutes giving it an eerie Beauty for anyone left to observe the spectacle what about the moon's orbit it's basically unchanged trying to move the moon with a nuke is like trying to move a truck by blowing on it nuclear explosions may be big but space is bigger our Mighty explosion just leaves another Ator one among Millions still anyone on the moon will continue to not enjoy themselves the material that ends up raining back to the Moon is radioactive and without any natural processes to wash it away or bury it the surface of the Moon will remain contaminated although fortunately the worst of the radiation will have decayed to a level comparable to Natural levels from cosmic rays in about a year in conclusion we can say with confidence that while the moon itself does not care about being m and we'll barely notice using the moon as a nuclear test ground kind of ruins it for everyone trying to spend some time there or to build something useful so maybe we should just not do that\", \"the desire to be free from the limits of The Human Experience is as old as our first stories we exist in an endless universe only Bound by the laws of physics and yet our Consciousness is trapped in Mortal machines made of meat with the breathtaking explosion of innovation and progress for the first time the concept of leaving our flesh piles behind and uploading our minds into a digital Utopia seems possible even like the logical next step on our evolutionary [Music] ladder upload what exactly mind is one of those words that are really hard to Define it's thought to be the collective abilities of your Consciousness and intelligence the thing that lets you imagine recognize and dream mind uploading is the hypothetical concept of making a copy of this inner world and transferring it into a computer to run a simulation of your Consciousness but even defining the premise gets really hard really fast the possibility of Mind uploading is based on three assumptions assumption one your mind is in your brain's structure Arrangement and biochemistry the idea that everything about the mind can be found in the brain is called physicalism and it keeps our discussion within the domain of natural law assumption two at some point we will understand the brain well enough and possess the technology to simulate all of its aspects to make a digital mind copy assumption three computer software can host your mind which means the mind is computable there is no physical property in the brain including Consciousness that cannot be simulated accurately even if it requires a lot of code all of these assumptions have been proposed and challenged by scientists and philosophers and they Remain the subject of passionate debate with so many fundamental questions still unanswered it's hard to discuss the topic without annoying someone whatever your position every discussion of Mind upload has to begin with the brain the brain in a nutshell the brain is the most complex biological structure known and deserves its own entire video so let's just take a brief look at it around 100 billion neurons are communicating via 1 million billion connections that are sending signals up to 1,000 times each second which is one quadrillion events every second of your Waking Life and it's not just neurons there are billions of supporting and immune cells of various types performing different jobs on a macro level the brain can be divided in two sections with different roles from breathing and heart rate to two coordinating movement and involuntary reflexes the most developed Parts the neocortex or the outermost layer of the brain hold memories our ability to plan think and imagine hope and dream where exactly the U part of the brain is situated is not entirely clear we know that areas like the precuneous cortex have the greatest influence on our Consciousness but also that several areas can Network together to share tasks none of them can do alone the brain's building blocks are not exactly simple either neurons are not just wires they alter and process information synapses where signals are handed over from one neuron to the next contain receptors for hundreds of chemical signals opening them up to outside influence we have a basic understanding of how these work and we can accurately predict their behavior at small scales but there's a lot more to the brain than just nerve signals hormones play a huge role like serotonin which affects our mood or histamine which helps us learn the brain is influenced by our other parts too from heart nerves to gut bacteria what seemed like a very complicated system to begin with gets even more complicated the more we learn about it to get this wildly interconnected mess of cells and meat and chemicals into a computer we need a model that we can simulate in our Digital World some sort of scan unfortunately our scanning technology like fmri machines is not nearly good enough to attempt such a thing but there is a different method that seems very promising cutting a brain into tiny slices and scanning them with a high resolution electron microscope to create an accurate map of all the cells and Connections in 2019 scientists successfully mapped a cubic millimeter of mouse brain roughly the size of a big grain of sand it contained 100,000 neurons with a billion synapses and 4 km of nerve fibers this grain of brain was cut into 25,000 slices five electron microscopes ran continuously for 5 months collecting more than 100 million images it took 3 months to assemble the images into a 3D model the completed data set fills up 2 million GB of cloud storage to scan a whole human brain we would have to repeat this effort a million times which is much easier said than done even worse to correctly simulate a brain we might even have to map out much smaller building blocks to include the billions of underlying proteins or even individual molecules that cause all the behaviors we see at the cellular level which might produce more data than the capacity of all data storage on Earth brain water to Consciousness wine while all of these issues are annoying the real question is how we turn the static blueprint of the brain into an active thing even if we have a scan down to the level of synapses we need laws and rules that animate the wiring diagram to endow this static structure with life update it with the various laws of chemical binding of electrodynamics to animate the simulation so it becomes a dynamic active thing like a brain that exists from one microc to the next that can evolve in time think see and act the reality is that we just don't know if this is possible to achieve if our technology can give rise to real Minds it all hinges on the nature of the problem are the brain and mind just complicated and a lot of work to figure out or are they complex in a way that we can't solve in the worst case Consciousness is more than the sum of the parts of the brain in a way that we don't realize yet complex in a way that we can't solve by getting better scans just having a list of the ingredients might not be enough to get a good Consciousness cake right now we have a great starting point with tangible scientific results and an end goal but the road to True simulation is unclear and requires a lot of innovation and research humans have historically been horrible at predicting the pace of progress in the best case it's just a matter of doing the work and finding the right Solutions it might not be necessary to simulate every last cell down to the last atom instead it may be possible to simplify elements into probabilistic models that could match the behavior of the brain using a more manageable number of simpler systems so we really don't know if we will ever understand our brain and Consciousness well enough to upload human minds but the science is real and worth pursuing at the very least we will just learn a lot about ourselves and develop a bunch of new technologies if we succeed this might put mind uploading well within the capabilities of our rapidly progressing computer technology the consequences for Humanity and our future in this universe are vast creepy and amazing the copy successful mind uploading is functional immortality unless damaged or deleted you will continue to exist as long as a copy is stored somewhere of course if the scan is corrupted in any of a myriad of ways your mind might get corrupted too you might be in an eternity of pain or paranoia or having an endless psychotic breakdown the question if this digital mind is you opens another whole can of worms for now we'll just assume that your digital mind at least feels like it's you how would mind uploading change your outlook on life will you feel safer knowing that death is is not necessarily the end or would you try to be super safe to avoid dying before your mind is uploaded if scanning technology does become Advanced enough your biological and digital versions could coexist you could help each other out by making your biological lifespan more enjoyable and the future of the copy more secure whatever happens your mind copy will begin a completely new life once it opens their digital eyes for the first time having a functional body is actually quite nice and you're pretty used to it food love pain and exhaustion all of these things are parts of us that we must live with but in the end they are the result of neurons firing in your brain so while you could decide to live in a simulated body it might be optional for a digital mind falling in love might lose meaning if you can have it at the Press of a button instead you might end up searching for new extraordinary experiences walk on the surface of the Sun speed up time to skip past a few boring months experience a simulation of the past your perspectives and priorities will change as you continue to exist in this liberated form the longer digital Minds exist eventually they will likely gain greater knowledge of themselves and an ability to change their own contents this can be a simple as deleting a memory that bugs you you might change aspects of your personality like grudges addictions or laziness without the constraints of biology your abilities might move up as technology progresses while your priorities or goals might become more and more foreign to your original brain if it's still alive waking up to the true potential of digital immortality will be gradual you can start projects that would take more than a lifetime to complete science ists could accumulate an incredible amount of knowledge leading to discoveries that could revolutionize the world adventurers could upload themselves onto small spaceships and embark on Journeys to the Stars just putting themselves on pause for thousands of years at a time although it's unlikely that every digital mind will work for the benefit of humanity since our current meat versions don't do that either some will seek power and influence and will have a literal eternity of trying to create Empires others will begin hoarding as many resources for themselves as possible as they compete with other Minds trying to do the same the longer they live the less sympathy they may feel for simple meat beings or imagine Immortal cult leaders who propagate lies and invent religions fine-tuning and perfecting their Dogma over hundreds of years or perhaps none of all that maybe our minds are not made for immortality and digital Minds will just become rigid and unproductive and retire after a very long life having experienced to everything they could ever want to it's hard to predict how much good or bad a self-improving mind could do with hundreds or thousands of years of free time and now we'd like to tell you a story about a quazar video that took us over 1,000 hours to

piece of matter in the universe you are attracted by an atom a million light years away and vice versa luckily this Force gets weaker over distance and it also depends on how massive something is so things that are close and are very massive or more attractive winning the cosmic tug of war this way massive things Define how smaller things behave around them the sun makes up 99.75% of all the mass in the solar system and so it shapes the behavior and orbits of everything else in it billions of years ago after the sun was born the solar system was a chaotic and dangerous place as the planets were formed from countless little pieces that collided constantly but over the eons a stable balance emerged today most planets and asteroids have settled into safe and predictable orbits we have the inner and outer planets the asteroid and kyber belt and at the edge the or Cloud a giant sphere of comets orbiting slowly in Cold Storage we really don't want this balance to be disturbed if another star came too close to us its gravity would pull on everything in the solar system like a spoiled toddler messing up the pleasant order of the planets and asteroids and comets this this isn't some imaginary danger some 70,000 years ago a red dwarf brown dwarf binary system passed through the orc cloud and mess things up it might even have sent a deadly onslaught of asteroids our way but it could take 2 million years until those visitors from the orc Cloud arrive in the inner solar system but there's a much bigger problem on the horizon glea 710 a red dwarf with about half the mass of the Sun is currently headed towards the solar system in about a million Years it'll pass through the or cloud and become the brightest star in the night sky a close flyby like this would unfold over hundreds of thousands of years disrupting the orbits of millions of objects in the OR Cloud considerably if we're unlucky it will trigger a new period of planetary bombardment similar to the early solar system the night sky could be filled with comets and asteroids raining down on the inner solar system the larger ones could cause dinosaur level mass extinctions and would would be bad for the stock market but it could get much worse the Galaxy is an intense place and stars get close to each other regularly so it is possible that a star could come much closer and not just pass us but fly directly through the inner solar system this would be very bad in the extreme the chance of another star colliding with the sun is astronomically unlikely but that isn't what we're worried about if another star were to pass by about as close as the Earth is from the Sun it could easily eject the Earth from the solar system the odds of such an event are estimated to be around 1 in 100,000 in the next 5 billion years small but not absurdly so as we discussed in another video there seem to be billions of rogue planets doing their own thing in the galaxy and this is one way to make them so if this were to happen with an average Red Dwarf what would happen on Earth kicking Earth out of the solar system as the star enters the solar system a small orangish dot appears in the sky that grows bigger and bigger for months eventually becoming visible during the day it would get bigger and much brighter than the moon too bright to look at directly the night sky would be filled with an eery red glow after a few months it would start shrinking again but so would the sun over a few years the sun slowly grows smaller in the sky and with it warmth and Light start to dissipate all around the world as the days turn dark the final winter of humanity would begin the polar ice caps begin to grow and spread while plants shrivel and die forests freeze and animals die in droves as the Earth passes the orbit of Mars the average surface temperature has plummeted to near -50° C from space Earth begins to look like an icy Moon the blue green surface becoming the pale Gray white of death AS Global infrastructure breaks down people huddle together indoors burning what they can for warmth as the temperature continues to drop counting the days until they'll be out of food which no longer grows everybody living at the surface is living on borrowed time by the time Earth reaches Jupiter's orbit surface temperatures sink to -150° cus lower than the coldest ever recorded temperatures in Antarctica needless to say by now almost everyone is dead without the energy from sunlight to evaporate water clouds don't form and the water cycle stops the polar ice caps eventually touch at the equator and the oceans become covered in a thick layer of ice as more and more of its heat leaks out more water freezes onto the bottom of the ice sheet the concentration of salt in the deep ocean grows poisoning most animals that survived here although around hydrothermal vents communities of extreme chumiles might adapt even to these circumstances deep below the surface some bacteria would not notice much of any of this as they're still kept warm by the radioactive decay of elements in the Earth's core as the Earth reaches the orbit of Pluto and the Kyer belt the sun is still the brightest star in the sky but it's one among many with stars now visible during the day the temperature is now barely 40° C above absolute zero below the freezing temperature of the gases in the atmosphere a weird spectacle enjoyed by no one unfortunately unfolds as the atmosphere turns into nitrogen and then oxygen snow over a few years it's deposited into an icy 10 m thick sheet all over the planet's surface with only a thin Whisper of gas remaining the Frozen corpses of Flora and FAA are buried beneath them as Earth leaves the solar system it becomes a rogue planet traveling alone through the dark lifeless and in solitude but weirdly enough there is hope Humanity would not be surprised by this potential Extinction event we'd notice it thousands of years in advance there's not a lot we could do to stop a star but we could prepare most of us would perish but a few million could survive in huge artificial complexes powered by geothermal and nuclear energy possibly even Fusion if we can learn to use the ice around us for power here Humanity might survive for hundreds of thousands of years at some point we would become used to our circumstances and new generations would watch documentaries in disbelief about the time we had our own star and could walk the surface of Earth and at some point we might decide to look for another home if the Earth were lucky enough to pass by another star with a habitable planet we could try to make a fresh start space flight oddly enough would become very easy without the atmosphere in the way so it's not Unthinkable that the last survivors would leave Earth behind and try again on a new planet around a new star maybe one day thousands of years later the descendants of humanity will tell legends about Earth's ancient past stories of our lost home of a mysterious icy Planet floating alone and empty through the dark of space welcome to the courtz kazak lab let's conduct a few Stellar EXP experiments we'll first add some

this channel possible [Music]\", \"In and out. In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem. And the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension might not matter to you or be a deadly danger depending on how big you are. Living things need a lot of different materials to keep themselves going. And they somehow need to transport them from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being alive because doing anything in our universe requires energy and the first living beings on earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after billions of years of evolution. So at the very beginning life needed to find a way to get good stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place and in another place there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements continue endlessly until at some point the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy and life loves free things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth, a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules. This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly. So the carbon dioxide diffuses out while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works for the very small world for bacteria, amoeba or your cells and a few very small animals. Insects, for example, have a fine network of trachea tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to contract their trachea. And at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles and airsacks. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface and diffusion of materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit of inside or volume and a lot of outside or surface area. But what if we wanted to create a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something 10 times larger, its outside or surface would grow by 100, but its insides or volume grows by 1,000 times. If we compare the bacterium pseudomonuso with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has 10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of outsides while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale, our giant bacteria now has too much insides and most of its inside is now very far from its surface. the oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides. From making it harder to be eaten to making it easier to eat others, but the size of cells is limited by the distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough resources. So life avoided this problem by forming multisellular structures. Beings composed of many cells instead of one because diffusion works better if you have many small units instead of one much bigger one. Over time the cell buddies began to share work and specialize. Some cells concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on movement. But that still wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained, limiting the size these first multisellular forms of life could attain. So in order to become even bigger, life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself. So diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells. Take yourself. What you consider your outside, your skin, has a surface area of about 2 m. But your lungs have a surface area of about 70 square m. They aren't like balloons. They're more like sponges filled with many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up with CO2 is pumped around the balloons. And then the magic of diffusion happens. The oxygen diffuses into the blood where it's picked up by red blood cells. And the CO2 diffuses out of the blood and into your lungs where it can be breathed out again. Your blood then carries oxygen rich blood into the furthest corners of your body and picks up the CO2 waste. Diffusion in the body is effective at about 1 mm. So every cell in your body is at most 1 mm away from a blood vessel. So medium-siz animals like you need a lot of blood vessels to reach every cell in the body. Your body has around 100,000 km of capillaries alone, the tiniest of your blood vessels with a surface area of around 1,000 m. This is true for all parts of you that want to exchange something with the outside world. Your body needs surfaces to take in nutrients from your food. So your gut has the surface area of half a benton court, roughly 40 square m. The larger you are, the more hidden surfaces you need. Take a tree. Its way to stay alive is to create sugar out of thin air and sunlight. So it needs as much surface area as possible. An orange tree with 2,000 leaves has a leaf surface area of 200 square m. But the surface inside the leaves where diffusion actually occurs is 6,000 square m. The same with roots where water diffuses from the soil into countless tiny hairs that maximize the surface area. The roots of one square meter of grass add up to around 350 m of surface. If we look at the breathtaking diversity of life on this planet, it seems like everything is pretty different. And it is. But some basic principles are the same for everybody and have not changed significantly for billions of years. If we look at the very very small or the very very big, waste goes out and fresh fuel comes in. Big animals just need a lot of complex plumbing to make it possible. This bird has magical powers. Let's see a demonstration. Bring in the latest scientific research. Wow, that's a lot of complicated stuff about the immune system and all its cells. How could someone possibly understand all of this? Incredible. This overview is delightful and easy to grasp, but still scientifically accurate. Let's make it a bit more difficult. Can she make all of evolution visible at a glance? This is brilliant. You can clearly see the relationships between species and how they evolved. And look at those illustrations.

unusually poor harvests while the warming oceans yield fewer fish each year in the tropical zones Millions suffer from famines and resource Wars have made Millions more flee to the north as things quickly get worse in an act of desperation the world's governments decide to enact an emergency plan it's far from certain that a grim scenario like this will play out but the failure of world leaders to effectively address climate change makes it far from impossible so in the near future it might become necessary to try something radical to slow down rapid climate change geoengineering interventions so massive in scale that they might undo centuries of human behavior or make everything much worse what is geoengineering is it really an option and what if it goes wrong [Music] geoengineering methods vary from Fantastic ones like constructing giant light sails in space to seeding clouds with salt or Wilder ones like fertilizing the oceans with iron to speed up the growth of trillions of algae cells in this video we'll focus on an intervention we could see during our lifetimes stratospheric aerosol injection a clunky term that means spraying stuff very high up in the atmosphere to keep the Sun away keeping the Sun away CO2 doesn't heat up the planet on its own almost all of the energy on Earth comes from the sun in the form of electromagnetic radiation about 71% of this energy is absorbed by the Earth's surface and atmosphere this absorbed energy is emitted again as infrared radiation and CO2 is able to trap this infrared radiation and keep it in the atmosphere for a while you can compare this effect with snuggling under a blanket in the morning even in a really cold room your body emits infrared radiation and the air between your body and the blanket traps it and creates a warm and comfy feeling so one way to cool down the planet would be to prevent energy from getting trapped under our planet blanket which is already happening naturally about 29% of the solar radiation hitting Earth is reflected back to space by bright surfaces like ice deserts snow or clouds more reflection less energy less warming we can look at nature for inspiration specifically the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the second largest volcanic eruption of the 20th century aside from massive Devastation and almost 900 dead scientists noted its strong impact on the global climate the explosion ejected millions of tons of particles and gas as high as the stratosphere which hung around there for a while the stuff that's interesting testing for geoengineering is sulfur dioxide a nasty smelling and invisible gas high in the atmosphere It produced a haze of sulfuric acid droplets that mixed with water and created giant veils these veils reduced the sunlight reaching Earth surface by roughly 1% global average temperatures dropped by 0.5° C it took 3 years until this cooling effect had stopped humans could imitate this process by injecting sulfur particles directly into the stratosphere According to some scientists this might be surprisingly easy to do and we don't even need a lot of new technology for it according to one study it also might be pretty cheap compared with the costs of Rapid climate change a small Fleet of specialized aircraft could Ascend once a year and distribute Aerosoles along the Equator from where they would be spread around the world projections assume that injecting between 5 and 8 megatons of material per year would reflect enough sunlight to slow down or even stop global warming giving us precious time to transition away from fossil fuels unfortunately there might be a few unhappy side effects there are a number of potential issues with aerosol injections rainfall patterns could change which could negatively affect agriculture and cause famine billions of people could be affected in the worst case also after the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption the acid water water veils not only cooled down the surface they also heated up the stratosphere as it turns out acid is bad for the ozone layer and the ozone hole over Antarctica was the largest it has ever been injecting sulfur particles over decades could have a similar effect scientists have already suggested using a combination of different minerals that might have much less harmful effects on the ozone layer but more research and experiments need to be done to make sure this could work but even if we don't damage the ozone layer there are other risks politicians and Industry might use the cooling effect as an excuse to delay the switch to a carbon neutral economy even if geoengineering slows down global warming humanity is still adding extra CO2 to the atmosphere more CO2 in the air means that the oceans absorb more CO2 which makes them more acidic this is already beginning to be deadly to huge ecosystems like coral reefs and the longer this continues the more severe the effects will be but it gets worse once we start pumping particles into the atmosphere on a massive scale we might be forced to do so for a long time or we could risk a termination shock what that means is that if Humanity continues to enrich the atmosphere with CO2 but at the same time prevents the planet from heating up by blocking solar radiation we're sitting on a time bomb once we stop geoengineering the natural cycle will take over again and Earth would heat up but after a few Decades of keeping the planet artificial cold while still releasing massive amounts of CO2 it would heat up much much quicker an increase in temperature that would take 50 years today could happen in just 10 years such a temperature shock in such a short time would disrupt every major system on Earth so much that it would be impossible to adapt in time the worst case scenario could be dramatic famines and the rapid destruction of ecosystems Humanity might survive but the survivors would inhabit an unfamiliar and hostile world world the best case scenario is that once the world has finally fully understood the existential danger of Rapid climate change geoengineering can bu us a crucial decade or two time to transition our economies and maybe even pull CO2 out of the atmosphere maybe with technologies that we'll discuss in a future video conclusion geoengineering is a scary concept it's not a solution to climate change and it might even be a welcome excuse for the fossil fuel industry to delay the end of the fossil fuel age over the last few decades geoengineering has been so controversial that it's stopped many scientists from doing the experiments necessary to understand it better but blankly opposing geoengineering is shortsighted the sad truth is we are already running a geoengineering experiment we're testing how fast the world changes if we add about 40 billion tons of CO2 each year this experiment is about to get really exciting hopefully we'll never have to use geoengineering but if we need to in the future we better have done the science we better be prepared or a panicking Humanity might accidentally press the self-destruct [Music] button it's time to reveal our darkest secret this may come as a surprise

Then they bury everything in the woods. 12,000 years later, an archaeologist is trying to figure out who you were, what was important to you, what video games you played, what you believed in, and what informed your decisions. because you happened to live during a remarkable time in human history, the planetary revolution, when humanity transitioned, becoming a multilanetary species. In that time, our numbers would explode by orders of magnitude. Our technology and standard of living would improve to levels previously thought impossible, and our self-conception would change forever. and all the future archaeologist has to learn about is your junk in the woods. While we can only hope that this will be someone's problem in 12,000 years, we have the same problem today. We're trying to reconstruct a revolution that took place 12,000 years ago. Today, only shadows remain of the people who experienced our distant past as their present. What remains from our past? We can look at our present in crispy 4K in color and sound. Three generations ago, the world was just black and white. One more generation and we see the world through blurred photographs. Further back, paintings and texts become our main way of experiencing the past. A mere 20 generations before us today, every written word had to be copied by hand, and reports became more scarce and less reliable. The first historian lived a mere 100 generations ago. Before him, there are only epics and legends and dead kings bragging on pieces of stone. 250 generations ago, there are only fragments left in the ground and images stripped of their original meaning. Eventually, humanity becomes basically invisible. Still, we do know some things about our ancestors. Let's try to tell their story and what it means for us today. The greatest transition in human history. For some 2 million years or roughly 80,000 generations, the life of our ancestors was basically the same. It was around 20,000 years or 800 generations ago that the behaviorally modern humans began a process that would change our lifestyle forever. At first, gradually for some of us, then faster for more of us, and then suddenly for almost all of us. Back then, there were about 1 million modern humans on Earth. Most other human species had died out, probably with a little help from us. Our ancestors biology had given them the necessary tools. A general intelligence to understand things, a social intelligence to understand each other, and language to express abstract ideas and create new concepts. These were people just like you. They suffered and experienced joy, were bored, cried, and laughed. They lived in communities of a few dozen people. They controlled fire and had tools made from wood, stone, and bone. told stories, mourned bare dead, and created art. They traded with other tribes, from obsidian to shellfish. Some hunted big game and were very mobile. Others relied more on plants they collected, and others mostly stayed in one area with an abundance of seafood. This was the common state of humanity for most of our history until a slow transition, step by step, turned into a revolution. step by step. The first solid evidence for this stems from the Jordan Valley, where our ancestors collected wild wheat more than 20,000 years ago. They noticed that seeds in the ground made more plants the next year. If they put good ones in one place, the next year they had more of the good ones. This was a great supplement to hunting and gathering. You could prepare some crops, return next year, build a temporary settlement, and have a secure food supply. Our ancestors used these bonus crops to bake the first bread, and brew the first beer. With every generation, they gathered deeper knowledge about the plants and animals around them, and how to manipulate them to their advantage. But there was a lot to learn. Very slowly from generation to generation, pockets of knowledge expanded and were passed along to be expanded again. This early agriculture started to drastically reduce the space our ancestors needed to feed one individual, which made it possible to stay in one place longer. Around 12,000 years ago, these little pieces of progress had reached a critical mass. Most of the calories we consume today stem from about 15 different founder crops that humans began to domesticate in earnest in the next few thousand years. What we call the agricultural revolution was not a thing that began suddenly one day. It was a slow process driven by small groups over many generations. Eventually, gradual change gave rise to a new era, the human era. During the next few thousand years, progress would speed up and turn hunter gatherers into farmers who lived in villages, towns, and then cities. When farmers moved into new areas, they replaced the nomadic tribes or turned them into farmers, too. This was neither easy nor painless. In the early days, people had a diverse diet made up of up to 250 different plants and animals. For some of the groups transitioning to agriculture, the variation in their diets declined drastically and some even seem to have been undernourished and living close together and with animals created a breeding ground for disease. Virtually every infectious disease caused by microorganisms that have adapted to humans arose in the last 10,000 years. Cholola, smallox, measles, influenza, chickenpox, and malaria. Mortality, especially among children, rose drastically. Still, our numbers grew because living in the same place enabled women to bear far more children than before. And for a farmer, more kids mean more hands to work the fields. Even with more people dying younger, villages and towns grew. The number of humans on Earth exploded. About 100 generations after the beginning of the human era, there were already 4 million of us. This increased the need for food and forced people to come up with ever more efficient ways of producing calories, solidifying our new lifestyle. Going back to hunting and gathering would have just meant death by starvation for most. One question remains unanswered. Why? Why would people exchange the freedom of living off nature with a huge variety in food for the grind of agriculture and often more limited diets? Nobody knows for sure. Climate change seems to have made the transition possible. And some scientists argue that it was caused by external factors like undernourishment or overpopulation, both highly contested. Today, the most widely accepted idea is that it was a deliberate choice made by countless communities around the globe. Maybe it's also connected with what makes us human. The ability to come together, develop shared identities, and exchange stories and knowledge. Some archaeologists think the groups of hunter gatherers traveled long and far to celebrate, to hold feasts and rituals. They would have used these occasions to talk about their version of innovation, better hunting and tool making techniques, how to catch and breed animals, and which plants could be collected and multiplied. Maybe they even exchanged seeds. It's not unlikely that these gatherings were the catalyst that spread the knowledge of agriculture through the many isolated groups of humanity, ultimately ending a lifestyle that was common to our species for thousands of generations. So, by being able to come together, celebrate, share, and learn from one another, these humans might have taken the steps that led to our modern world, and we have much to be grateful for. We are still the same humans today, even if it often doesn't feel that way. Maybe it's time to come together to share what we know and celebrate our existence once again to begin another peaceful transition. Maybe the planetary revolution that will change everything once more. So hopefully in another 12,000 years, our descendants will look back on us today with gratitude for the amazing world they are able to inhabit. And now we'd like to tell you a story about a Quartzkazart video that took us over 1,000 hours to create. It all started with a simple idea. We stumbled upon something truly or inspiring. A piece of knowledge so important we wanted to share it with as many people as possible. So we got to work. It took many days and nights, but finally we managed to craft a perfect script. Then the illustration and animation burps took over and the visual magic began. And at last, after over 1,000 hours of hard work, this video was ready to be released to the world, bringing joy and inspiration to so many people.

Almost every year breaks some horrible record, from the harshest heat waves to the most rapid glacier melt. It\\'s endless, and relentless. We\\'ve known for decades that rapid climate change has been caused by the release of greenhouse gases. But instead of reducing them, in 2019 the world was emitting 50% more CO₂ than in the year 2000. And emissions are still rising. Why is that? Why is it so hard to just stop emitting these gases? Our collective CO₂ emissions can be expressed as a product of four factors and their relationship with each other. Two of them explain why worldwide CO₂ emissions are still rising, and two explain how we can stop that. Population Size, Economic Growth, Energy Intensity, and Emissions pere Energy unit produced. Number 1: Population Size People need food, homes, and clothing. And they demand luxury products from iPhones to one dollar cheeseburgers more people = higher CO₂ emissions. It\\'s a very simple equation. The global population is growing, and according to the UN it will level off at about 11 billion in 2100, which is 40% more than today. The only way to slow down this growth is investment in healthcare, and access to contraception and education in developing countries. But even with massive investment, it will take a few decades for the effects of lower birthrates to manifest themselves, so the global population will keep growing for the foreseeable future, and, as a consequence, global CO₂ emissions rise over the next few decades. Number 2: Growth, or \"Getting Richer\". But it\\'s not just about our numbers, The richer and more developed we are, the more emissions our lifestyle produces. A programmer in the US has a higher CO₂ footprint than 50 farmers in Uganda. The world\\'s wealth is growing almost everywhere. And although it\\'s far from easily distrubuted, economic growth has led to the highest standards of living, and the largest reduction in extreme poverty in human history. Growth has become the dominant mantra of the world\\'s economies, no matter what kind of political system they have. It\\'s unlikely that rich countries will give up the concept of growth any time soon. But even if they were to, developing countries want to become rich too For billions of people, the end of growth would probably mean staying poor and so developing countries are not willing to stop growing their economies. All in all, we can agree that growth as a guiding economic ideology is not going to go away any time soon. More countries and their citizens around the world will grow and become richer while the rich economies will continue to grow their wealth. There are some signs that growth can be decoupled from CO₂ emissions but we\\'re not close to that yet. As a consequence of this growth, CO₂ emissions will rise. Ok, so far we\\'ve learned that because of population growth and economic growth, humanity\\'s CO₂ emissions will increase. ...which is the opposite of what should be happening. We need to slow, peak, and then reduce annual emissions. The next two factors describe how we can actually do this. Number 3: Energy Intensity Energy intensity describes how efficiently we use energy. A street food vendor in rural Brazil might burn coal to cook... while a street food vendor in France might use an induction stove powered by nuclear energy. The latter is way more efficient. The more efficient something is, the less energy we need to do something. Be it powering a metropolitan area, or grilling a kebab. So making our technology more efficient, and coming up with more efficient ways to organise our societies is one of the most important ways to reduce the modern world\\'s CO₂ dependancy. This can mean everything from reducing power consumption with A.I., the electrification of the transportation and industrial sectors, or sustainable concrete production. The opportunities for improvement are almost limitless, and human ingenuity can run wild. But we know that increasing efficiency alone will not be enough, mostly for 3 reasons: 1: Direct Rebound Effects. This means that once something becomes more efficient, it\\'s used more, and so overall, the increased efficiency does not lead to a reduction as impressive as you would first think. ...or worse, sometimes more efficiency makes humans use not *less* of a resource, but *more* of it. When planes became more fuel-efficient, ticket prices decreased, and more people started to travel by plane. So making things more efficient does not automatically mean less energy use in total. It might have the opposite effect. 2: Indirect Rebound Effects. Sometimes when you save money on a thing that becomes more efficient, you might spend it elsewhere. For example, if you buy a more fuel-efficient car, you save money on fuel, and end up with extra funds in your bank account... ...that you might spend on vacation, and take a flight with. So in the end, you might actually emit more CO₂ despite getting a more efficient car. 3: And lastly, the more you optimise for efficiency, the harder and more expensive it becomes to get more efficient. So, over time, the return on investment slows down. And, with many technologies, we are already pretty efficient. But, regardless of how efficient we make our economies, as long as we need at least some energy, we will have emissions. Efficiency alone won\\'t create a zero-carbon world. This brings us to our last factor: Number 4: CO₂ emissions per energy unit used, or \"Our Global Carbon Footprint\". Humanity\\'s global carbon footprint is the CO₂ released per energy unit generated. For example, coal plants release much much more CO₂ than solar power per unit of energy. This relationship is crystal clear. The more fossil fuels we burn, the higher our CO₂ output. Fossil fuels are the greatest lever humanity has right now. Of course, it\\'s impossible to shut down coal and oil overnight without throwing society into chaos. But the reality is, that we\\'re not doing nearly enough to keep fossil fuels in the ground and use lower-carbon alternatives We need to do 2 things to speed the transition away from fossil fuels. First, we need to use the real leverage we have today, with today\\'s technology There are a lot of things we can do extremely quickly. We can leave nuclear power plants online longer. We can cut subsidies to the fossil fuel industry, and funnel them into renewables. We can price carbon emissions harshly, and increase the price each year to create strong incentives for the world\\'s industries to transition. We can enforce strict standards for energy efficiency, and for any type of new construction. We can phase out fossil fuel vehicles. Next, we also need to invent new and better technology. Without new technologies and innovation, it will be impossible to achieve a zero CO₂ emission world, be it from technologies like carbon capture, or a new generation of nuclear power plants, to new batteries that revolutionise the energy storage from renewables. But innovation takes time: years, and decades... ...and we don\\'t have this time. Every year, we keep adding more carbon to the atmosphere. This means we can\\'t keep relying on innovation alone. We need to find ways to reduce emissions today, while we invent what we will need in the future. The less fossil fuel we burn over the next few years, the more time we give innovation to catch up. The more low-carbon energy infrastructure we build today, the more we can compensate for economic growth, and the people born today. The more coal power plants in construction we stop from being finished, the more CO₂ we save. Neither innovation, nor the alternatives we\\'re using today alone can solve rapid climate change. But, innovation, together with a decisive move away from fossil fuels where it\\'s possible today could do it. Solving climate change will be complicated. We have to account for the needs of billions of people and the reality that right now, society runs mostly on fossil fuels. This will not change overnight, but it needs to change as quickly as possible. And it is still very much possible🤞🏻 We\\'ll look at different aspects of climate change, and how to solve it in more videos. Let us know what kind of stuff you want to know more about Here on YouTube, or join us in our subreddit This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates, that\\'s working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net-zero carbon emissions Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data, for helping us out with data & research *quack* 🦆', \"What is the largest star in the universe and why is it that large? And what are stars anyway? Things That Would Like To Be Stars We begin our journey with Earth. Not to learn anything, just to get a vague sense of scale. The smallest things that have\\nsome star-like properties are large gas giants, or sub-brown dwarfs. Like Jupiter, the most massive\\nplanet in the solar system. Eleven times larger and 317\\ntimes more massive than Earth, and more or less, made of\\nthe same stuff as our Sun. Just much, much less of it. The transition towards stars\\nbegins with brown dwarfs, failed stars, that are a huge\\ndisappointment to their moms. They have between 13 and 90\\ntimes the mass of Jupiter. So even if we took 90 Jupiters and\\nthrew them at each other, although fun to watch, it wouldn't be enough to create a star. Interestingly, adding lots of mass\\nto a brown dwarf doesn't make it much bigger, just its insides denser. This increases the pressure\\nin the core enough to make certain nuclear fusion\\nreactions happen slowly, and the object glow a little. So brown dwarfs are a sort of glowy\\ngas giant, that don't fit into any category very\\nwell. But we want to talk about stars, not failed wannabe stars, so let's\\nmove on. Main Sequence Stars Once large gas balls pass a certain\\nmass threshold, their cores become hot and dense\\nenough to ignite. Hydrogen is fused to helium in their\\ncores, releasing tremendous amounts of energy. Stars that do that are called \\nmain sequence stars. The more massive a main sequence star is, the hotter and brighter it burns, and the shorter its life is. Once the hydrogen-burning phase is over, stars grow up to hundreds of \\nthousands of times their original size. But these giant phases only last for a\\nfraction of their lifespan. So we'll be comparing stars at \\ndrastically different stages in their lives. This doesn't make them less impressive, but maybe it's good to keep in mind\\nthat we'll be comparing babies to adults. Now back to the beginning, the smallest real stars are red dwarfs. About 100 times the mass of Jupiter; barely massive enough to fuse\\nhydrogen to helium. Because they are not very massive they are small, not very hot, and shine\\npretty dimly. They are the only stars in the main\\nsequence that don't grow once they die but sort of fizzle out. Red dwarfs are by far the most abundant type in the universe, because they burn their fuel so slowly, it lasts them up to ten trillion years - a thousand times the current age of\\nthe universe. For example, one of the closest stars\\nto Earth is a red dwarf star, Barnard's Star, but it shines too dimly to be seen\\nwithout a telescope. We made a whole video on red dwarfs\\nif you want to learn more. The next stage are stars like our Sun. To say the Sun dominates the solar system is not doing it justice since it makes up 99.86% of all its mass. It burns far hotter and brighter than\\nred dwarfs, which reduces its lifetime to about 10\\nbillion years. The Sun is 7 times more massive than\\nBarnard's Star, but that makes it nearly 300 times\\nbrighter with twice its surface temperature. Let's go bigger! Small changes in mass produce enormous changes in a main sequence star's\\nbrightness. The brightest star in the night sky,\\nSirius, is 2 solar masses with a radius 1.7 times that of the Sun, but its surface is nearly 10,000°C, making it shine 25 times brighter. Burning THAT hot reduces its total lifespan by 4 times to 2.5 billion years. Stars close to 10 times the mass of\\nour sun have surface temperatures near 25,000°C. Beta Centauri contains two of these\\nmassive stars, each shining with about 20,000 times\\nthe power of the Sun. That's a lot of power coming from something only 13 times larger, but they'll only burn for about 20\\nmillion years. Entire generations of the blue stars\\ndie in the time it takes for the Sun to orbit the galaxy\\nonce. So is this the formula? The more massive, the larger the star. The most massive star that we know\\nis R136a1. It has 315 solar masses and is nearly 9 million times brighter\\nthan the Sun. And yet, despite its tremendous mass\\nand power, it's barely 30 times the size of the Sun! The star is so extreme and barely held\\ntogether by gravity that is loses 321 thousand billion tons of material through its stellar wind every single second. Stars of this sort are extremely rare\\nbecause they break the rules of star formation a\\ntiny bit. When supermassive stars are born they burn extremely hot and bright and this blows away any extra gas that could make them more massive. So the mass limit for such a star is around 150 times the Sun. Stars like R136a1 are probably formed\\nthrough the merger of several high mass stars in dense star-forming regions and burn their core hydrogen in only\\na few million years. So this means they are rare and short\\nlived. From here the trick to going bigger\\nisn't adding more mass. To make the biggest stars we have to kill them. Red Giants When main sequence stars begin to exhaust the hydrogen in their core it contracts making it hotter and denser. This leads to hotter and faster fusion which pushes back against gravity and makes the outer layers swell in a\\ngiant phase. And these stars become truly giant indeed. For example, Gacrux. Only 30% more massive than the Sun, it has swollen to about 84 times its\\nradius. Still, when the Sun enters the last\\nstage of its life, it will swell and become even bigger; 200 times its current radius! In this final phase of its life it will swallow the inner planets. And if you think THAT'S impressive let's finally introduce the largest stars\\nin the universe: Hypergiants Hypergiants are the giant phase of the \\nmost massive stars in the universe. They have an enormous surface area that can radiate an insane amount of \\nlight. Being so large they're basically\\nblowing themselves apart as gravity at the surface is too weak to \\nhold on to the hot mass which is lifted away in powerful stellar \\nwinds. Pistol Star is 25 solar masses but 300 times the radius of the sun; a blue hypergiant aptly named for its \\nenergetic blue starlight. It's hard to say exactly how long Pistol\\nStar will live but probably just a few million years. Even larger than the blue hypergiants are the yellow hypergiants. The most well studied is Rho Cassiopeiae; a star so bright it can be seen with the \\nnaked eye although it's thousands of lightyears from Earth. At 40 solar masses, this star is around 500 times the\\nradius of the Sun, and 500,000 times brighter. If the Earth were as close to Rho \\nCassiopeiae as it is to the Sun it'd be inside it and you would be very\\ndead. Yellow hypergiants are very rare though. Only 15 are known. This means they're likely just a \\nshort-lived intermediate state as a star grows or shrinks between\\nother phases of hypergiantness. With red hypergiants we reach the\\nlargest stars known to us. Probably the largest stars even possible! So who's the winner of this insane\\ncontest? Well the truth is we don't know. Red hypergiants are extremely bright\\nand far away which means the even tiny\\nuncertainties in our measurements can give us a huge margin of error for\\ntheir size. Worse still are solar system sized\\nbehemoths that are blowing themselves apart which makes them harder to measure. As we do more science and our\\ninstruments improve whatever the largest star is will change. The star that is currently thought to\\nbe among the largest we've found is Stephenson 2-18. It was probably as a main sequence\\nstar a few tens of times the mass of the sun and has likely lost about half its mass\\nby now. While typical red hypergiants are 1500\\ntimes the size of the Sun, the largest rough estimate places\\nStephenson 2-18 at 2150 solar radii, and shining with almost half a million\\ntimes the power of the Sun! By comparison the Sun seems like a\\ngrain of dust. Our brains don't really have a way of\\ngrasping this kind of scale. Even at lightspeed it would take you \\n8.7 hours to travel around it once. The fastest plane on Earth would take\\naround 500 years! Dropped on the Sun it would fill\\nSaturn's orbit! As it evolves it would probably shed\\neven more mass and shrink down into another hotter\\nhypergiant phase, accumulate heavy elements in its core, before finally exploding in a core\\ncollapse supernova, giving its gas back to the galaxy. This gas will then go on to form\\nanother generation of stars of all sizes. Starting the cycle of birth and death\\nagain to light up our universe. Let's make this journey again but this time without the talking. The universe is BIG. There are many large things in it. If you want to play a bit more with size\\nstuff we have good news! We've crated our first app, Universe In\\nA Nutshell, together with Tim Urban, the brain\\nbehind Wait But Why. You can seamlessly travel from the\\nsmallest things in existence, past the coronavirus, human cells and dinosaurs, all the way to the largest stars\\nand galaxies, and marvel at the whole observable\\nuniverse! You can learn more about each object, or simply enjoy the sheer scale of it all. The app is inspired by the Scale Of\\nThe Universe website by the Huang twins, that we spent a lot of time with when\\nit came out years ago, and felt that it was finally time to\\ncreate a Wait But Why and Kurzgesagt version. You can get it in your app store, there are no in-app purchases, and no ads. All future updates are included. And since this is our first app we'd love to hear your feedback so we can improve it over time. If this sounds good to you download the Universe In A Nutshell\\napp now and leave us a 5-star review if you\\nwant to support it. Kurzgesagt and all the projects we do\\nare mostly funded by viewers like you! So if you like the app we'll make more\\ndigital things in future. Thank you for watching!\", \"Deep in tropical jungles \\nlie floating kingdoms, ruled by beautiful and deadly masters. They're sort of the high elves\\nof the ant kingdoms; talented architects that\\ncreate castles and city-states. But they are also fierce\\nand expansionist warriors, and their kingdoms are ensnared\\nin a never-ending war for survival. 'Oecophylla Weaver Ants' [Intro music] Oecophylla weavers walk on long legs, have slender bodies, and large eyes, which make them look pretty cute. Although, their strong mandibles\\nand the ability to shoot acid also make them pretty good at killing. But more on that later. Their colonies usually have\\ntwo to three worker classes that vary dramatically in size: majors, minors, and sometimes\\neven tiny minim workers. Depending on location and species, they vary in color from dark\\nbrown to emerald green. Other than their fancy looks,\\nwhat makes weavers special is that they're in the\\nkingdom-building business. They like to build at\\npretty much all heights, starting in shrubs a few\\ncentimeters above the ground, and up to 10 meters in the tree canopy. But, they're not satisfied\\nwith ruling just one plant. Weavers will look for twigs or lianas\\nthat bridge the gap to other trees, and expand to every plant they can reach. This way, colonies spread upwards\\nand sideways through the treetops. The largest weaver ant\\nkingdoms we know of occupy up to 1,600 square meters, around four basketball courts, a lot of ground to cover for tiny ants, and impossibly hard to control. So, weaver ants construct dozens of\\nnests scattered all over their territory: outposts to defend the kingdom, tubes or balls made from leaves,\\nand ghostly silk sheets. These masterpieces\\nof high-ant architecture are created by the weaver majors, the larger worker ants, which are\\nresponsible for the more dangerous jobs like fighting, foraging,\\nand nest construction. To start a new nest, a major tries to bend different leaves\\nin her surroundings into a tube. If one of the leaves is flexible enough,\\nmore workers will arrive to help. Chains of workers pull\\nthe leaf's edges together or reach across gaps and grab distant\\nleaves to add them to the construction. While the bending and pulling is going on, other workers carry larvae from the\\nclosest nest to the construction site. Usually, ant larvae spin themselves\\na cocoon to protect themselves. But the weaver ant larvae give all of their\\nsilk to the colony as building material. So, when the workers tap the\\nlarvae's heads on the leaf, they release their sticky thread\\nlike tiny, cute glue guns. This way, the workers sew the bent leaf\\nonto itself so it won't unfold anymore. This creates a central chamber, that's used as the basis for up to 300\\nmore leaves that are wound around it. Together, they form little pockets and act\\nas additional rooms for the new outpost. To make it even more cozy, minor workers use the larvae to weave\\nadditional floors and chambers. Nests are usually constructed as\\nbarracks on the territory's borders, or as storage for brood and food supplies. This way, the ants don't need to cross\\nvast distances to the headquarters, but have soldiers close to\\nany potential point of conflict. Apart from one special nest\\nin the middle of the network, which is reserved for the\\nqueen and her guards. Here, she produces\\nhundreds of eggs a day, which get transferred to suitable\\nnests with brood chambers. So, a colony is a network\\nof little castles and moats, connected by suspension bridges\\nmade from leaves, lianas, and twigs. An established colony easily has half a\\nmillion individuals that need to be fed. Fortunately, weaver ants\\nevolve to have very close and beneficial relationships\\nwith their hosts: shrubs and trees. The tree gives the ants a home\\nand access to sweet sap to drink. But maybe even more importantly,\\nit allows them to cultivate cattle, like aphids or caterpillars, that\\nproduce honeydew for them. This would usually hurt a tree, but these insects belong\\nto a small group of VIPs. Only a few selected neighbours and the\\nants' cattle are allowed on the fruit tree. Many other insects, and even\\nlarger herbivores are scared off, or even killed and eaten. So in most cases, the tree only has to\\ntolerate acceptable levels of damage while being protected from\\nmore dangerous pests. The weaver ant kingdom could be an\\nant paradise if there wasn't competition, mostly from other kingdoms. Just like medieval humans, every queen seeks to conquer others\\nand make their land their own. Controlling fertile land is the\\nkey to survive in the jungle. And if a kingdom loses too much of it, it\\nshrinks and is overrun or starves to death. So expanding and defending their borders\\nis critical to keep the colony alive. When a kingdom invades another, it first gathers an army of\\na few thousand majors who make their way towards\\nthe opposing colony. The goal is to steal a bit of\\nterritory and take it over. Defending weaver patrols\\nquickly spot the invaders and immediately release\\nan alarm pheromone. Some rush to the front to defend, while others rush to the\\nclosest outposts for help, marking their route with pheromones. Whenever they meet other sisters, they jerk their bodies as if in a fight, to signal them to follow the\\npheromone trail to the front line. At the site of battle, majors from\\nboth parties raise their bodies, circle each other with\\nmandibles wide open, and try to seize their opponents. If an ant gets a hold of her opponent, the victim is pulled into a group of\\nallied majors and pinned down. The ants then rip the victim apart, clipping off antennae and legs, and slicing open their abdomens. To slow down the advance of the attackers, the defending majors squirt\\nformic acid over the battlefield, to chemically burn their targets. This is soon answered in the\\nsame way by the attackers. In the chaotic battle, both parties lose countless fighters\\non the increasingly acidic battlefield. After a few minutes, the backup\\nfrom the outposts arrive, and the time window for a\\nsuccessful attack slowly closes. This is when the battle turns. The defenders slowly push\\nback the attack party. In the end, the attackers can't\\nkeep up and have to retreat. For both parties, it was a costly battle. Thousands of corpses lie piled up\\non the ground under the battlefield, and many ants are severely injured. The defending colony's nests\\nand brood are safe though. The attackers' attempt to steal\\nnew valuable territory has failed... ...for today. They'll try again soon. But the kingdom will be ready. For the high ants of\\nthe floating kingdoms, war is nothing special. It's just a fact of life. Because as we know, empires\\nnever, ever have enough. And the weaver ants are ready to fight. *quack*\\n[Outro music] [Outro music]\", \"Аhhh, casually watching a video on YouTube on a computer more powerful than anything humanity could build a few decades ago. Тhis progress and all the wonderful machines you take for granted are built on a few rare and precious materials with names like Terbium, Nneodymium or Tantalum. Getting these rare materials from the ground into your devices is ugly The mining industry is responsible for air and water pollution and the destruction of entire landscapes. Dangerous chemicals like cyanide, sulphuric acid or chlorine are used to extract the resources, harming biodiversity, workers and locals. And rare resources are also political tools, when countries restrict access to them to get their way. But what if we could replace the mining industry on earth, with a clean process that can't harm anyone? Well, we can; all we need to do is look up. (catchy introductory music by Kurzgesagt) Asteroids are millions of trillions of tons of rocks, metals, and ice. Leftovers from the cloud that became the planet 4.5 billion years ago. They can be as small as a meter or proto-planets the size of entire countries. Most of them are concentrated in the asteroid belt and the Kuiper belt while hundreds of thousands more do their own thing between the planets. As space travel is becoming more feasible scientists and economists have been begun looking at the resources found in these asteroids. Even relatively small metallic asteroids may contain trillions worth of industrial and precious metals like platinum. And bigger asteroids like 16 Psyche could contain enough iron nickel to cover the world's metal needs for millions of years. At current market prices the rare raw materials alone would be worth quadrillions of dollars. Well, not really. But technically. For example, there are more than 20 million tons of gold in the ocean's water worth roughly 750 trillion U.S. dollars. But filtering out the gold would be so expensive that you'd lose money selling it. Right now asteroid mining has exactly this problem. It's too expensive to replace mining on Earth. Billions of dollars worth of valuable resources in space are worthless if it costs trillions to get them. What makes it so hard? The principals behind mining an asteroid are simple. The basic idea is to choose an asteroid move it to a place where it's easy to process, and then take it apart to turn into useful products. Unfortunately all of this collides with fundamental problems humans have yet to solve Going to space is expensive. It costs thousands of dollars in rocket fuel for each kilogram, just to reach a low earth orbit. Going further out into deep space costs thousands more. We need cheaper space travel to make asteroid mining profitable. One solution is to switch from classical rockets to electric spaceships. We already use electrical rocket engines\\nfor many of the space probes on science missions. In principal, we only need to build bigger ones. While electrical engines are not powerful enough to fly to space they require only a tiny amount of fuel to go very far once they're in space. This means we don't need to spend a lot of money on fuel only to transport fuel into space. This doesn't solve the whole cost problem- but it makes it easier to start our first mission. Now that we have an electric asteroid-mining spaceship, we need to find the right asteroid and get it there. We've already successfully visited asteroids with space probes and even collected samples. Still, to make it easier and cheaper our first targets will probably be near-Earth asteroids. Asteroids that orbit, well, near Earth. After a few months of travel our spaceship finally arrives at an asteroid. Weirdly formed, littered with small impact craters, it hasn't changed much for billions of years. The first thing that needs to be done is\\nto secure the asteroid and stop it from spinning. There are multiple ways to do this, like vaporizing material with a laser or stopping the rotation with thrusters. Once we have a stable asteroid, we need to wait. Orbital mechanics are complicated, but if you push something in the right direction\\nat exactly the right moment, you can move very big things with very little force. So, we wait for exactly the right moment. Our ship fires its thrusters and nudges the asteroid into a trajectory that takes it near our Moon. The Moon is useful because we can borrow its gravitational pull to put the asteroid\\nin a stable orbit around Earth, which saves even more fuel. Again, the trip takes months. But all the time since our ship was launched\\nhas not been wasted. The first space mining and processing equipment\\nhas been installed in orbit, and is now carefully moving towards the asteroid. The processor works very differently than on Earth. Giant mirrors focus sunlight and heat up asteroid rock to boil out the gases. Grinders break up the dried rocks into gravel and dust, and centrifuges separate dense from light elements. Even if we only extract 0.01% of the asteroid's mass\\nin precious metals, this is still several times more than\\nyou'd get from the same amount of ore on the ground. But what now? How do we get our\\nprecious metals safely back to ground? There are a few ways, like\\nloading it into reusable rockets that return to Earth from space. Or if our processor contains 3-D printers, we can print a faster and cheaper delivery system. Heat shielded capsules filled with gas bubbles. These can just be dropped into the oceans\\nwhere ships tow them away. This could be the starting point of\\nhumanity's first real steps towards colonizing the solar system. As our infrastructure and experience grows, our missions get more and more sophisticated. Parts and fuel produced on asteroids don't have to be launched from Earth at all. The first mining operation makes the second one easier,\\nand so on. While the space industry grows and precious materials become cheaper, eventually we could stop mining on Earth. Even the idea of toxic mining down here might become something weird and anachronistic, like having an open fire in your living room. Landscapes ravaged by pollution will heal, while the technological wonders we're used to get cheaper and less toxic to make. None of this is science fiction. We don't need fancy materials or new physics to make asteroid mining happen. We could start building this future today. All we need is an initial ... push!\", \"An observable universe is a big place\\nthat's been around for more than 13 billion years. Up to two trillion galaxies made up of\\nsomething like 20,000 billion billion stars surround our home galaxy. In the Milky Way alone, scientists assume there are some\\n40 billion earth-like planets in the habitable zone of their stars. When we look at these numbers, it's hard to imagine\\nthat there is nobody else out there. It would change our perception of ourselves forever\\nif we found others. Just knowing that this vast place is not dead\\nwould shift our perspective outward, and could help us get over\\nour irrelevant quarrels. But before looking for our\\nnew best friends, or worst enemies, we have a problem to solve:\\nWhat are we actually looking for? [Kurzgesagt intro] In a universe that big and old, we have to assume that civilizations\\nstart millions of years apart from eachother, and develop in different directions and speeds. So not only are we looking over distances of\\ndozens to hundreds of thousands of light years, we're looking for a civilization\\nranging from cavemen to super advanced. So, we need a conceptual framework\\nto enable us to think better thoughts that make us able to search better. Are there universal rules that\\nintelligent species follow? Currently our civilization sample size is only one, so we may make incorrect assumptions\\nbased solely on ourselves. Still, better than nothing. We know that humans started out with nothing\\nbut minds and hands that could build tools. We know that humans are curious, competitive,\\ngreedy for resources, and expansionist. The more of these qualities our ancestors had, the more successful they were\\nin the civilization building game. Being one with nature is nice, but it's not the path\\nto irrigation systems, or gunpowder, or cities. So it's reasonable to assume that aliens able to\\ntake over their home planet also have these qualities. And, if aliens have to follow\\nthe same laws of physics, then there is a measurable metric for progress:\\nEnergy use. Human progress can be measured very precisely\\nby how much energy we extracted from our environment, and how we made it\\nusable to do things. We started with muscles,\\nuntil we learned to control fire. Then we made machines that\\nused kinetic energy from water and wind. As our machines got better\\nand our knowledge of materials expanded, we began to harness the concentrated energy\\nfrom dead plants we dug up from the ground. As our energy consumption grew exponentially,\\nso did the abilities of our civilization. Between 1800 and 2015,\\npopulation size had increased sevenfold, while humanity was consuming\\n25 times more energy. It's likely that this process\\nwill continue into the far future. Based on these facts, scientist Nikolai Kardashev\\ndeveloped a method of categorizing civilizations, from cave dwellers to gods ruling over galaxies: The Kardashev Scale;\\na method of ranking civilizations by their energy use. The scale has been refined and\\nexpanded on over the decades, but in general it puts civilizations\\ninto four different categories. A Type 1 civilization is able to use the\\navailable energy of their home planet. A Type 2 civilization is able to use the\\navailable energy of their star and planetary system. A Type 3 civilization is able to use the\\navailable energy of their galaxy. A Type 4 civilization is able to use the\\navailable energy of multiple galaxies. These levels differ by orders of magnitude. It's like comparing an ant colony\\nto a human metropolitan area. To, ants we are so complex and powerful,\\nwe might as well be gods. So to make the scale more useful,\\nwe need subcategories. On the lower end of the spectrum,\\nthere are Type 0 to Type 1 civilizations: Anything from hunter-gatherers, to something\\nwe could achieve in the next few hundred years. These might actually be\\nabundant in the Milky Way. But a civilization that is not\\nactively transmitting radio signals into space might be as close as our nearest stellar neighbor,\\nthe Alpha Centauri system, and we would have no way of\\nrealizing they exist. But even if they transmitted radio signals\\nlike we do, it might not be very helpful. On an interstellar scale,\\nhumanity is practically invisible. Our signals may extend over\\nan impressive 200 light years, but this is only a tiny fraction\\nof the Milky Way. And even if someone were listening, after a few light years\\nour signals decay into noise, impossible to identify as\\nthe source of an intelligent species. Today, humanity ranks at about level 0.75. We have altered our planet: we've created huge structures,\\nmined and stripped mountains, removed rainforests, and drained swamps. We've created rivers and lakes, and changed the composition and temperature\\n of the atmosphere. If progress continues,\\nand we don't make Earth uninhabitable, we will become a full Type 1 civilization\\nin the next few hundred years. Any civilization that becomes a Type 1\\nis bound to look outside, because it's likely that it's still curious,\\ncompetitive, greedy and expansionist. The next reasonable step towards transitioning to Type 2\\nis trying to alter and mine other planets and bodies. This might start with outposts in space,\\ntransition to infrastructure and industries near the home planet, move on to colonies,\\nand end with terraforming other planets, by changing their atmosphere,\\ntheir rotation, or position. As a civilization expands and\\nuses more and more stuff and space, its energy consumption scales with them, so at some point, they may embark on the largest project\\na lower Type 2 civilization can take on: harnessing the energy of their star\\nby building a Dyson Swarm. Once this megastructure is finished, energy has become practically unlimited\\nfor molding the home system however they see fit. If they are still curious, competitive,\\ngreedy and expansionist, and now have complete control\\nover their home system, stellar infrastructure in place,\\nand the energy output of a star, the next frontier moves to\\nother stars light years away. For a Type 2 civilization, the distance to other stars might feel like\\nthe distance between Earth and Pluto does to us today: Technically within reach, but only with immense investments\\nin terms of time, ingenuity, and resources. This begins their transition\\ntowards Type 3. This step is so far beyond us that it becomes hard to imagine\\nwhat exactly these challenges will look like, and how they'll be solved. Will they be able to find a solution\\nto the vast distances and travel times of\\nhundreds or thousands of years? Will they be able to communicate and keep a shared\\nculture and biology between colonies light years apart? Or will they split into\\nseparate Type 2 civilizations? Maybe even different species? Are there deadly challenges between the stars? So the closer a species gets to Type 3, the harder it becomes to fathom\\nwhat it might actually look like. They might discover new physics,\\nmay understand and control dark matter and energy, or be able to travel faster than light. We might be unable to grasp their\\nmotives, technology, and actions. Humans are the ants, trying to\\nunderstand the galactic metropolitan area. A high Type 2 civilization might already consider\\nhumanity too primitive to even talk to. A Type 3 civilization might feel about\\nas like we feel about the bacteria living on the anthill. Maybe they wouldn't even consider us conscious,\\nor our survival relevant. We could only pray that they're nice gods. But the scale doesn't necessarily end here. Some scientists suggest there might be\\nType 4 and Type 5 civilizations, whose influence stretches over\\ngalaxy clusters or superclusters, structures comprising thousands of galaxies\\nand trillions of stars. Ultimately, there might be\\na Type Omega civilization, able to manipulate the entire universe,\\nand possibly others. Type omega civilizations might be\\nthe actual creators of our universe, for reasons beyond our comprehension. Maybe they were just bored. As flawed as this classification may be, this thought experiment is\\nalready telling us interesting things. If our ideas about the nature of species that\\nform interstellar civilizations is sort of correct, then we can be pretty sure that there are\\nno civilizations of Type 3 and beyond near the Milky Way. Their influence would in all likelihood\\nbe so all-encompassing, and their technology so far above our own,\\nthat we couldn't miss them. The galaxy should flash with their activity\\nin thousands of star systems. We should be able to see or detect their artifacts or movements\\nbetween different parts of their empire. Even if a Type 3 civilization did exist in the past,\\nand died a mysterious death, we should be able to detect\\nsome of the remnants of their empire. But when scientists looked,\\nthey didn't find remnants of harvested stars, decaying megastructures\\nor scars of great interstellar wars. So they're very likely not out there\\nand never were. In a sense, this is very sad,\\nbut also very reassuring. It leaves the galaxy to us and\\nothers similar to us. So the most promising civilizations to look for may be\\nsomewhere in the spectrum from Type 1.5 to Type 2.5. They wouldn't be too advanced to\\nunderstand them and their motives. They may have finished their first megastructures, and they might be in the process of\\nmoving staff between stars, transmitting enormous amounts of information\\ninto space, by accident, or on purpose. They would probably also look to the stars\\nand look for others. Then again, maybe we've got it all wrong. Maybe progress to Type 2\\ndoes not mean expanding outwards, and humanity is still too immature\\nto imagine otherwise. For now, all we really know is that\\nwe haven't seen anybody yet. But, we've only just started looking.\", \"Humans are proud of a lot of things, from particle accelerators to poetry to Pokemon. All of them made possible because of something humans value extremely highly: Intelligence. We think of intelligence as a trait like height or strength, but when we try to define it, things get fuzzy. In a nutshell, intelligence is a mechanism to solve problems. Especially the problem of staying alive, which involves finding food and shelter, fighting sexual competitors, or fleeing from predators. Intelligence is not a single thing; it includes the ability to gather knowledge, to learn, be creative, form strategies, or engage in critical thinking. It manifests itself in a huge variety of behaviors. From hardwired or instinct like reactions to different degrees of learning, to some sort of awareness. But not all scientists agree where it begins or what even should count as intelligence. To make this even more complicated, intelligence is also connected to consciousness since awareness is helpful for problem-solving. But we're exploring consciousness in other videos, so today we'll leave it aside. Okay, Intelligence isn't exactly clear-cut, so maybe we can think of it as more like a flexible set of skills: A toolbox. Basic tools. The most basic tools in the intelligence toolbox are the ability to gather information, to save it, and to use it to learn. Information about the world is gathered through senses such as vision, sound, smell, touch or taste, and helps us navigate and react to the external world appropriately. But living things also need to keep track of the state of their own bodies, monitoring things like hunger and fatigue. Information is the basis of action for all living things, and without it, you're at the mercy of your surroundings, unable to react appropriately, or flexibly. Information is much more powerful if we can keep and save it, so the second tool is memory. Memory is the ability to save and recall information, so a living being doesn't have to start from scratch every time it perceives something relevant. Memories can be about events, places, and associations, but also behaviors like hunting or foraging methods. Some of these, like flying, have to be repeated over and over until they're mastered. This is what we call learning, the process of putting together a sequence of thoughts or actions. Basically a string of repeatable behaviors that can be varied and adapted. These three tools enable seemingly stupid creatures to act in surprisingly intelligent ways. The acellular slime mold, which is basically just a single huge slimy cell, shows behavior similar to an animal with a simple brain. When put in a maze with food at one end, the slime mold explores its surroundings, and marks its path with slime trails, sort of, smearing memories on the ground. As it continues exploring, it avoids the marked pathways and finds its way to the food. Instead of blindly getting stuck in dead-ends, the slime mold adapts its behavior to save time and effort. This behavior is hardwired, and scientists can't agree if that's intelligent, although it does give the slime mold a certain advantage. Bees are an example of more adaptive smart behavior. Scientists trained bumblebees to move a colored ball into a goal post for a sugar reward. Not only were the bees very skillful at this behaviour, which isn't natural to them, they got more efficient over time. When several balls were available, bees chose the ball that lay closest to the goal, even if it was a different color than the ball they were trained with. For more challenging problems, we need even more flexibility: Fancier tools. Building on the basic tools, more complex animals have a wider range of problems they can solve. They can memorize all kinds of associations, connections, and mechanical tricks. We'll call this tool “The Library of Knowledge”. Take raccoons. Their favorite kind of food is human food. Their approach to getting hold of such treats depends upon an assortment of theoretical and practical skills, that makes them master burglars, able to open windows or pick locks. In a study, raccoons were given boxes secured with different kinds of locks, like latches, bolts, plugs, or push bars. They needed less than 10 attempts to figure out how to open each box. Even when different locks were put together into increasingly difficult combinations that had to be solved in the right order, and with different amounts of strength. A year later, the raccoons still remembered how to open the boxes, and were as fast as when they had first solved the puzzle. Beyond our library of associations and skills, the most impressive tool in our box is creativity, a sort of mental duct tape. Being creative means producing something new and valuable from apparently unrelated things. In the context of intelligence this means making new and unusual connections. Pairing input with memories and skills, to come up with a unique solution to a problem. In another raccoon study, researchers showed the animals that by dropping pebbles into a water tank, they could raise the water level enough to reach a marshmallow floating at the top. One raccoon came up with a much better solution: it tipped the tub over. Another facet of creativity is applying a new resource to a task: Physical tools. Like primates that use sticks to fish for termites in trees, or some octopuses, which assemble collected coconut shells around themselves as a sort of portable armor to hide from enemies. Collecting materials for later use is connected to an even more advanced dimension of problem-solving: Planning. Planning means considering the activities required for a desired goal and putting them together in a plan. When unforeseen circumstances and new possibilities present themselves, they need to be assessed according to whether they match the plan or not. An example of this intelligent behavior is hoarding food to eat it later. This is an instinctive behavior in squirrels. But even though hiding food comes instinctively to them, they still need to use advanced thinking skills to make the best decisions. Squirrels examine every nut and weigh the time and effort it would take to hide it, against the benefits they would get from each one. Damaged or low-fat nuts are eaten right away, while nuts that still need to ripen go on the stockpile. Squirrels also pretend to bury nuts when they feel watched. These empty caches distract rivals from their real treasure. This is pretty advanced strategizing because to make a plan to distract someone else, you first have to be aware that there are others like you that want the same things. The more complex the problem, the more tools are needed in combination to solve it. So the more tools there are, the more flexibility a being has to solve the challenges life throws at them. But even for complex problems, each animal's individual situation is what counts. Squirrels are omnivores that defend their territories fiercely. For them, it makes sense to remember where there's food in different locations and trick their enemies to improve their chances of survival. Sheep don't have any such refined tricks up their sleeve, but they don't need to. They are grazers and live in flocks. The skills relevant to them are social. They recognize and remember many different sheep, and even humans for years; a completely different skill. Evolving and retaining a complex set of mental abilities they might never use would be a waste of resources for them. Humans went the opposite way and invested in an unusually diverse intelligence toolkit. While this was helpful, by accident we added another set of tools on top: Culture. No single person could ever build a space rocket or particle accelerator. But thanks to our ability to work together and to share knowledge across generations, we can overcome challenges beyond any single individual's ability. This allowed us to shape the planet to our liking. We also created new problems in the process: sudoku, tax forms, string theory. But also rapid climate change and antibiotic resistance. To solve these, we'll need to look past short-term survival and think about the distant future. We have the toolbox, we just need to use it. Speaking of tools for learning, we've heard from many teachers that are using our infographic posters in class. So we asked what would help them the most and made an education edition for teachers, students, and everyone else. They're slightly larger posters about various things that we'll expand over time. From a periodic table, to a world map or the human body. You can get them in our shop and support us if you want. And let us know which poster topics you want for your room or classroom. This video was part two of a three-part video series relating to big questions of life and the universe, made possible thanks to a grant from the Templeton World charity foundation. You'll find our sources and further reading in the video description. (Breezy outro music)\", \"Since the Industrial Revolution, humans have released over 1.5 trillion tons of carbon dioxide or CO₂, into the Earth's atmosphere. In the year 2019, we were still pumping out around 37 billion more. That's 50 percent more than the year 2000 and almost three times as much as 50 years ago. And it's not just CO₂, we're also pumping out growing volumes of other greenhouse gases such as methane and nitrous oxide. Combining all of our greenhouse gases, we're emitting 51 billion tons of carbon dioxide equivalents each year. And emissions keep rising. But they need to get down to zero. In recent years, the consequences have become more serious and visible. Almost every year breaks some horrible record: We've had more heat waves, the most glaciers melting, and the lowest amount of ice ever recorded at the North Pole. Of the last 22 years, 20 have been the hottest on record. The only way to limit this rapid climate change is to decrease our collective emissions quickly. But although all countries agree on this goal in principle, they do not agree who is responsible or who should bear the heaviest load. The developed countries point at their own efforts to reduce emissions and the fact that the large developing countries on the rise, especially China, are currently releasing much more CO₂. On the other hand, developing countries argue that emissions by the West are lifestyle emissions, while for developing countries, they are survival emissions. Others call rich countries hypocrites that got rich by polluting without restraint and now expect others not to industrialize and stay poor. So who is responsible for climate change and CO₂ emissions? And regardless of the past, who needs to do the most today? In this video, we'll talk exclusively about nation-states. We'll look at the fossil fuel industry in another video. Question 1 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide today? In 2017, humans emitted about 36 billion tons of CO₂. More than 50% came from Asia. North America and Europe followed with 18% and 17%. While Africa, South America, and Oceania together only contributed eight percent. China is by far the world's largest emitter with 10 billion tons of CO₂ every year, or 27% of global emissions. It's followed by the USA with 15% and the European Union with around 10%. Together, this is more than half of the world's CO₂ emissions. So it's clear that without the willingness and action of these three industrial blocs, humanity will not be able to become carbon neutral and prevent severe climate change. Next on our list is India at seven percent, Russia at five percent, Japan at three percent, and Iran, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, and Canada all just short of two percent. Together with the first three, the top 10 are responsible for 75% of global emissions. But if we only look at the current situation, we're not getting the full picture. Question 2 of 3: Which countries have emitted the most in total? If we look at emissions throughout history until today, the outlook changes drastically. The US and the EU both knock China off the top spot. The US is responsible for 25% of the world's historical emissions emitting 400 billion tons, mostly in the 20ᵗʰ century. In second place is the EU at 22%. China comes in third at just under 13 percent, around half of the USA's contribution. India's contribution shrinks to 3 percent along with the whole of Africa and South America. The UK is responsible for one percent of annual global emissions but takes five percent of the historical responsibility. Germany, producing two percent of emissions per year today, has contributed almost six percent, as much as the whole of Africa and South America combined. So the narrative that rapid climate change is really the responsibility of the developing world is hard to defend if facts matter to you. But this is still not the whole story, because focusing on countries mixes two things: population numbers and total emissions. If a country has more people in general, its emissions are of course higher. Things look very different if we look at individuals like you, dear viewer. Question 3 of 3: Which countries emit the most carbon dioxide per person? The average human is responsible for around five tons of CO₂ each year, but averages can be misleading. The countries with the largest CO₂ emissions per person are some of the world's major oil and gas producers. In 2017, Qatar had the highest emissions at a hefty 49 tons per person, followed by Trinidad and Tobago, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Brunei, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. But those are outliers. Australians have one of the highest carbon footprints per person: 17 tons a year. That's more than triple the global average and slightly more than the average US American and Canadian at 16 tons. The Germans do a little better at close to 10 tons, but this is still twice the global average. China may be the world's largest emitter, but it's also the world's most populous country with over 1.4 billion people, 18.5% of the world population. Per person, it's above average at seven tons. Historically, CO₂ emissions have been closely tied to a high standard of living. Wealth is one of the strongest indicators of our carbon footprint, because as we move from poor to rich, we gain access to electricity, heating, air conditioning, lighting, modern cooking, cars or planes, smartphones, computers, and interact with people across the world online. The enormous rise of China's CO₂ emissions is coupled with the greatest reduction of poverty in history. If we order CO₂ emissions by income, we see that the richest half of countries are responsible for 86% of global emissions and the bottom half for only 14%. The average German emits more than five times as much as the average Indian. In just 2.3 days, the average American emits as much as the average Nigerian in a year. And not only that, the harsh reality is that it's the countries that contribute least to the problem that stand to lose the most from rapid climate change. The developing world will be hit the hardest. The consequences could be food insecurity, conflicts over resources, harsher and more frequent natural disasters, and large climate refugee movements. Question 4... of 3: So who should take responsibility? Many of today's richest countries are in a convenient position. They have become rich over centuries of fossil fuel burning and industrial production. They have a large historical footprint, and their wealth means they still emit a lot per person. But their country's annual emissions are now dwarfed by other countries, because the giant that is China is finally catching up, and other giants like India are on their way. Many Germans, for example, wonder how if Germany only accounts for two percent of yearly emissions, it can have a meaningful impact on reducing emissions. The answer is simple. For one, the richest countries have the resources, highly educated workforces, and technology to develop low-cost, low-carbon solutions and spread them around the world. If we don't want poorer countries to become as fossil fuel-dependent as we are, we need low-carbon technology to be cheap and available. And we're getting there. The cost of renewables is falling quickly and a variety of solutions are on the horizon for many different sectors. But it needs to happen much faster. If the rich countries of the West decide to seriously tackle rapid climate change, the rest of the world would follow, because it has no choice. Just like when the European Union enforced energy efficiency standards for technology, the rest of the world adopted them too, because they wanted to be able to continue trading with the block. Still, this doesn't absolve others of their responsibility. China is the largest CO₂ emitter today, and it's China's responsibility to grow in a way that will make it possible to transition to a zero-carbon world in time. Others acting irresponsibly yesterday is a horrible excuse for repeating the same mistakes today. Climate change is a global problem, and no country alone can fix it. Working out who's responsible is not as simple as it seems, and in a way, it's a daft question, but one that has plagued international politics for decades. In the end, it's pretty simple. Everybody needs to do the best they can, and right now we are all not doing that. But we can begin today. This video is part of a series about climate change supported by Breakthrough Energy, a coalition founded by Bill Gates that's working to expand clean energy investment and support the innovations that will lead the world to net zero carbon emissions. Also, a special thanks to the team at Our World in Data for helping us out with data and research. [Calm outro music]\", \"The Sun, smooth and round and peaceful. Except when it suddenly vomits radiation\\nand plasma in random directions. These solar flares and coronal\\nmass ejections, or CMEs, can hit Earth and have serious\\nconsequences for humanity. How exactly do they work? How bad could they be? And can we prepare for them? [Intro music] While the Sun seems pretty solid,\\nit's actually like a very hot ocean. So hot that it rips atoms into electrons and nuclei,\\nall flowing around each other in a plasma. This plasma is pushed around and\\nshaped by the Sun's magnetic field. Similar to how the Sun's gravitational field reaches\\nout to the planets and shapes their orbits. But magnetism is very different from gravity. Magnetism is one part of a dual force: \\nElectromagnetism. Electricity creates magnetic fields,\\nand magnetic fields create electricity. On the Sun, the plasma—made of electrically\\ncharged protons and electrons— creates a magnetic field as they move, and this magnetic field then\\nshapes the flow of particles. They're stuck in a dynamic\\nfeedback loop called a dynamo, which keeps the sun's\\nmagnetic field alive. This magnetic field stores\\nenormous amounts of energy and leaks out over the Solar System. It carries with it a constant trickle of solar plasma,\\nlike a light rain, known as the solar wind, creating a sort of space weather. But it isn't always calm and smooth. As the sun's plasma churns\\nand flows around itself, its magnetic field gets\\nall kinked and twisted. This creates magnetic knots that\\nbuild up enormous amounts of energy. When the magnetic knots break—like a\\ntangle of springs exploding outwards— the Sun can vomit plasma and other\\nawful things into the Solar System. These solar storms come in many types, like solar flares; a tidal wave\\nof high-energy radiation. They race through the solar system at the speed\\nof light, sweeping up protons in the solar wind, accelerating them into a\\nhigh-speed solar-proton storm. Then, there are coronal mass ejections, which rip millions or billions of tons\\nof plasma from the Sun's atmosphere, catapulting it through the solar system at\\nspeeds of up to 9 million km/h. When these monsters hit us,\\nnothing happens on Earth. While even smaller storms\\ncan damage satellites, affect radio communication, or be dangerous to astronauts, for people on the surface,\\nspace weather is harmless. Earth's atmosphere protects us from\\nthe worst effects of a solar flare by absorbing the blast of X-rays\\nhigh up in the atmosphere, well before it reaches the surface. The electrified plasma from a CME is\\ndeflected by the Earth's magnetic field, diverting the energy storm to\\nthe North and South Poles, where energetic particles\\nfall into the atmosphere, causing the atmosphere to glow\\nand creating beautiful auroras. As with any sort of weather—\\nmost of the time, things are fine. Sometimes, there are hurricanes, though. Or in the case of the Sun,\\nsolar superstorms. And we know that they happen\\nonce or twice every century. If one were to happen today, we\\nwould first detect strong solar flares, a sort of flash before the much\\nmore dangerous thunder. The thunder is a CME, consisting of\\nbillions of tons of hot magnetic plasma that crosses the 150 million kilometers\\nbetween the Sun and Earth in less than a day. When it arrives, it causes a shockwave that\\nviolently compresses the Earth's magnetic field and transfers energy into\\nthe magnetosphere. But it can get worse. If the magnetic field of the CME is\\naligned to Earth's in just the right way, the two magnetic fields merge. As the magnetic cloud passes over Earth,\\nit stretches the Earth's field into a long tail. Eventually, the energy stored in the\\ntail becomes too much to contain. It snaps and explosively releases\\nits energy towards Earth. A geomagnetic storm has begun. A few hundred years ago,\\nnobody would have cared. This storm gushing over the Earth is not relevant\\nfor machines made out of meat and bones. But it's very relevant for machines\\nmade out of metal and wire. Remember the dynamo? Magnetism creates electric currents. Earth in the 21st century is covered in millions\\nof kilometers of wires, transporting electricity, and a complex grid of machines, like\\ntransformers, that make this transfer possible. A CME's energy can induce currents in our power\\ngrid that can either completely shut it down, or worse, destroy the transformer\\nstations that keep our grid running. This has happened already, like when the Quebec power grid failed\\nafter a strong solar storm in 1989. But in general, our engineers know\\nhow to deal with these storms, and so we usually don't even notice. The last time a solar hurricane\\nwashed over Earth was in 1859: The Carrington Event, the largest geomagnetic storms\\never observed on Earth. Massive auroras occurred\\nas far south as the Caribbean. In some places, they were\\nso bright that people got up, thinking the Sun was rising. Luckily, we only had one\\nsort of modern technology: telegraph systems. They failed all over the world, shocking their operators\\nand chucking out sparks. Today, we have a tad more technology, and our luck may run out soon. Another bad solar storm is\\nbound to happen eventually. A storm as strong as the Carrington Event\\nmissed earth only by a small margin in 2012. Studies projected that it would've inflicted\\nserious damage to electronic systems globally, costing up to $2.6 trillion to the US alone. The time to replace all the damaged systems\\nwas estimated at between 4 and 10 years. It's hard to say how bad\\nit could have been. Experts disagreed. Some assumed there would\\njust be temporary blackouts, but others worried it\\ncould be much worse. We won't know for sure until\\na big solar hurricane hits us. The probability of such an event is\\nestimated to be 12% per decade. That's about a 50/50 chance of\\nat least one in the next 50 years. And, there is more unsettling news. A 2019 paper found that\\neven calm stars, like our Sun, can create superflares\\nevery few thousand years. Eruptions orders of magnitude\\nstronger than the strongest storms we have observed in the Solar System. If such a storm hits us unprepared, the\\nconsequences could be catastrophic. It's hard to overstate how much\\nwe depend on electricity. It's not just the lights at home. It means no computers, no communication, no navigation. A sustained power outage might lead\\nto a breakdown of the supply chain, water supply systems failing and hospital generators running dry, supermarkets not being refilled while food rots in the fields. The lack of power might make it extremely\\nhard to reboot our broken power grid, taking years or decades to\\nrestart our starving civilization. Okay, time to panic? As much as daily newspapers might like for\\nsolar storms to send us back to the Stone Age, they probably won't. Fortunately, even though solar\\nstorms aren't preventable, virtually all of their nasty side effects are. Scientists observing the Sun have a few hours\\nup to a few days to see a CME coming. And the engineers working the\\nsystems that keep the world running are well aware of the risks\\nposed by solar storms. Transformers and substations\\ncan be taken offline— short preventative blackouts— or in other words, by unplugging stuff. Engineers can open up extra lines\\nto dissipate the extra power. And with investment and upgrades cheap\\ncompared to those other natural disasters require, we could protect the world's electric grid\\nagainst even the nastiest of storms. But we do need to prepare. While the risk is manageable, it is real. For while our Sun bathes us\\nin warm and pleasant light, one day, it might send a monster our way that we better be ready for.\", 'Today we\\'re doing something different. Our friend John Green will read a story from his podcast, \"The Anthropocene Reviewed\". We hope you enjoy it and we\\'ll be back with a regular video, Soon. So if you\\'ve ever been or had a child, you will likely already be familiar with hand stencils. They were the first figurative art made by both our kids somewhere between the ages of 2 and 3. My children spread the fingers of one hand out across a piece of paper, and then with the help of a parent, traced their five fingers. I remember my son\\'s face as he lifted his hand and looked absolutely shocked to see the shape of his hand still on the paper - a semi permanent record of himself. I am extremely happy that my children are no longer 3 and yet to look at their little hands from those early artworks is to be inundated with a strange, soul splitting joy. Those pictures remind me that they are not just growing up, but also growing away from me, running toward their own lives. But of course that\\'s meaning I am applying to their hand stencils and that complicated relationship between art and its viewers is never more fraught than when we are looking deeply into the past. In September of 1940, an 18 year old mechanic named Marcel Ravidat was walking his dog Robot in the countryside of southwestern France, when the dog disappeared down a hole. Robot eventually returned, but the next day Ravidat went to the spot with three friends to explore the hole and after quite a bit of digging they discovered a cave with walls covered with paintings, including over 900 paintings of animals: horses, stags, bison and also species that are now extinct, including a woolly rhinoceros. The paintings were astonishingly detailed and vivid with red, yellow and black paint made from pulverized mineral pigments that were usually blown through a narrow tube, possibly a hollowed bone, unto the walls of the cave. It would eventually be established that these artworks were at least 17,000 years old. Two of the boys who visited the cave that day were so profoundly moved by the art they saw, that they camped outside the cave to protect it for over a year. After World War II the French government took over protection of the site and the cave was open to the public in 1948. When Picasso saw the cave paintings on a visit that year he reportedly said, \\'\\'We have invented nothing.\\'\\' There are many mysteries at Lascaux. Why, for instance, are there no paintings of reindeer, which we know were the primary source of food for the Paleolithic humans who lived in that cave? Why were they so much more focused on painting animals than painting human forms? Why are certain areas of the cave filled with images, including pictures on the ceiling that required the building of scaffolding to create, while other areas have only a few paintings? And were the paintings spiritual -- \"here are our sacred animals\"? Or were they practical -- \"Here is a guide to some of the animals that might kill you\"? Aside from the animals, there are nearly a thousand abstract signs and shapes we cannot interpret, and also several \"negative hand stencils\" as they are known by art historians. These are the paintings that most interest me. They were created by pressing one hand with fingers splayed against the wall of the cave and then blowing pigment, leaving the area around the hand painted. Similar hand stencils have been found in caves around the world, from Indonesia to Spain to Australia to the Americas to Africa. We have found these memories of hands from 15 or 30 or even 40 thousand years ago. These hand stencils remind us of how different life was in the distant past. Amputations likely from frostbite are common in Europe. And so you often see negative hand stencils with three or four fingers. And life was short and difficult. As many as a quarter of women died in childbirth; around 50% of children died before the age of five. But they also remind us that the humans of the past were as human as we are. Their hands indistinguishable from ours. These communities hunted and gathered and there were no large caloric surpluses. So every healthy person would have had to contribute to the acquisition of food and water, and yet somehow they still made time to create art. Almost as if art isn\\'t optional for humans. We see all kinds of hands stenciled on cave walls, children and adults, but almost always the fingers are spread. Like my kids\\' hand stencils. I\\'m no Jungian. But it\\'s fascinating and a little strange that so many Paleolithic humans, who couldn\\'t possibly have had any contact with each other, created the same paintings the same way -- paintings that we are still making. But then again, what the Lascaux art means to me is likely very different from what it meant to the people who made it. Some academics theorized that the hand stencils were part of hunting rituals. Then there\\'s always the possibility that the hand was just a convenient model situated at the end of the wrist. To me, though, the hand stencils at Lascaux say, \"I was here.\" They say, \"You are not new.\" And because they are negative prints surrounded by red pigment, they also looked to me like something out of a horror movie. Like ghostly hands reaching up from some bloody background. They remind me that, as Alice Walker wrote, \"All history is current.\" The Lascaux cave has been closed to the public for many years now. Too many contemporary humans breathing inside of it led to the growth of mold and lichens, which has damaged some of the art. Just the act of looking at something can ruin it, I guess. But tourists can still visit an imitation cave called Lascaux II, in which the artwork has been meticulously recreated. Humans making fake cave art to save real cave art may feel like peak Anthropocene behavior. But I have to confess that even though I am a jaded and cynical semi-professional reviewer of human activity, I actually find it overwhelmingly hopeful, that four teenagers and a dog named Robot discovered a cave with 17,000-year-old handprints, that the cave was so overwhelmingly beautiful that two of those teenagers devoted themselves to its protection. And that when we humans became a danger to that caves\\' beauty, we agreed to stop going. Lascaux is there. You cannot visit. You can go to the fake cave we\\'ve built, and see nearly identical hand stencils. But you will know this is not the thing itself, but a shadow of it. This is a handprint, but not a hand. This is a memory that you cannot return to. All of which makes the cave very much like the past it represents. We hope you enjoyed this video even if it was different. Check out John Green\\'s podcast, \"The Anthropocene Reviewed\", where he poetically reviews the human world we live in. John is a good friend of Kurzgesagt. In fact without his channel, Crash Course, that he and his brother Hank started years ago, Kurzgesagt would not exist, because it was the original inspiration for what we do today. And over the years, John and Hank have helped us in a multitude of ways, from advice to just being friends. So check out \"The Anthropocene Reviewed\" or any of their many channels.', 'At this very second, you are on\\na narrow ledge between life and death. You probably don\\'t feel it, but there\\'s\\nan incredible amount of activity going on inside you, and this activity can never stop. Picture yourself as a Slinky falling down \\nan escalator moving upwards. The falling part represents the self-replicating processes of your cells. The escalator represents the laws of physics driving you forwards. To be alive is to be in motion but never arriving anywhere. If you reach the top of the escalator, there\\'s no more falling possible, and you are dead forever. Somewhat unsettlingly, the universe wants you to reach the top. How do you avoid that? And why are you alive? [Amazing-sounding Kurz Intro Music] All life is based on the cell. A cell is a piece of the dead universe that separated itself from the rest so it could do its own thing for a while. When this separation breaks down, it dies and joins the rest of the dead universe again. Unfortunately, the universe would like for life to be done with doing its own thing. For some reason, it\\'s not a fan of exciting things, but tries to be as boring as possible. We call this principle \"entropy,\" and it\\'s a fundamental rule of our universe. It\\'s pretty complicated and counterintuitive, so we\\'ll explain it in detail in another video. For now, all you need to know is living things are inherently exciting. A cell is filled up with millions of proteins and millions more simpler molecules like water. Thousands of complex, self-replicating processes are happening up to hundreds of thousands of times every second. To stay alive and exciting, it has to constantly work to keep itself from achieving entropy and becoming boring and dead. The cell has to maintain a separation from the rest of the universe. It\\'s doing this, for example, by keeping the concentration of certain molecules different on the inside and the outside by actively pumping out excess molecules. To do stuff like this, a cell needs energy. Energy is the ability of things in the universe to do work; to move or manipulate a thing; to create change. This ability cannot be created or destroyed. The set amount of energy in the universe will never change. We don\\'t know why, it just is that way. So, billions of years ago, one of the most crucial challenges for the first living beings was to get usable energy. We don\\'t know a lot about the first cells, except that they got their energy from simple chemical reactions. And they found the ultimate energy transfer system: the energetic building block of life. The molecule Adenosine Triphosphate, or ATP. Its structure makes it uniquely good at accepting and releasing energy. When a cell needs energy, for example, to pump out molecules or to repair a broken micro machine, it can break down ATP, and use the chemical energy to do work and create change. This is why living beings are able to do stuff. We don\\'t know when or how exactly the first ATP molecule was made on earth. But every living thing we know uses ATP, or something very similar, to keep its internal machinery running. It\\'s crucial for almost every process. Plants, fungi, bacteria, and animals need to survive. Without ATP, no life on Earth. Possibly anywhere. While breaking down chemicals for energy is nice and all, early life did miss out on the greatest available source of energy: The Sun. The Sun merges atoms and radiates photons away that carry energy into the solar system. But this energy is raw and indigestible. It needs to be refined. After hundreds of millions of years of evolution, finally, a cell figured out how to eat the Sun. It absorbed radiation and converted much of it into neat little chemical packages that it could use to stay alive. We call this process: Photosynthesis. You take photons that are wobbly with electromagnetic energy, and use a part of this energy to merge and combine different molecules together. The electromagnetic energy is converted into chemical energy stored in the ATP molecule. This process became even better, as some cells learned to create better chemical packages: Glucose, or sugar. Easy to break down, high in energy, and pretty tasty. This is so convenient, that some cells decided that instead of doing all that pesky photosynthesis work themselves, they would just swallow other cells that did, and take their glucose and ATP. This is widely considered one of the biggest anime betrayals in evolutionary history. And so things went on. Photosynthesizing cells could mostly harness energy at their surfaces, which limited their maximum energy production, which limited their evolutionary avenues somewhat. So, time passed. Some cells made sugar, others ate them. Evolution did its thing, but overall things stayed pretty much the same for hundreds of millions of years. Until, one day, a cell ate another, and did not kill it. Instead, they became one cell. Nothing had changed that day, but Earth would be different forever. This cell became the ancestor of all animals on this planet. Blue whales, amoeba. Dinosaurs, jellyfish. Pink fairy armadillos, and Sunda colugos. And of course, you. All can trace back their existence to this moment. The merging of two living beings is so important, because when those two cells became one, they became way more powerful. The formerly independent cell in the inside, could stop trying to survive. It could concentrate on one thing: make ATP. It became the powerhouse of the cell: the first mitochondria. The host cell\\'s job became to ensure survival in the dangerous world, and provide the mitochondria with food. Mitochondria basically reverse photosynthesis, in a similarly complex process. They take sugar molecules that we got from eating other living things, combust them with oxygen and precursor molecules, to make new, energy-rich ATP molecules. This process works like a tiny furnace and spits out waste products like CO2, water, and a little bit of kinetic energy that you experience as body heat. This first division of labor, meant the new cell had way more energy available than any cell before, which meant more possibilities for evolution to enable more complex cells. At some point, these cells began to form small groups or communities, which lead to multicellular life, and finally, to you. Today, you are a pile of trillions of cells, each filled with dozens, if not hundreds of little machines that provides you with usable energy to stay alive. If this process is interrupted, even for a few minutes, you die. (Teaser of Kurzgesagt: Science War, coming in 2021.) But if life is so fragile, wouldn\\'t it be a good idea to store ATP, like we store sugar in our fat cells, so we don\\'t die if we stop breathing for a while? If life has solved so many problems to make you live today, what\\'s up with the dying quickly thing? Even simple bacteria like E. Coli make about 50 times their body weight in ATP for every cell division. Your trillions of cells need a lot of ATP to keep you around. Every day, your body produces and converts about 90 million, billion, billion molecules of ATP: about your own body weight. You need a whole person\\'s worth of ATP just to make it through a single day. Even storing enough ATP to last you a few minutes is basically impossible. An ATP molecule is really good for shifting energy around quickly, but it\\'s terrible for storage, since it has only one percent of a glucose molecule\\'s energy at three times its mass. So ATP is constantly produced and used up fairly quickly. This was the short and simplified story of the molecule that allows you to be different from the dead universe, and to be the slinky on the escalator. It is a weird story. There is this molecule you need to survive at all times. You need it to keep moving, because even a short break brings your slinky to a stop. And you need to make it yourself. It\\'s like driving a car at full speed while producing fuel in the trunk with junk that you pick up from the side of the road. As far as we know, this all began billions of years ago, when tiny parts of the dead universe came together and became something else for a moment. It could keep itself going. It could grow. That moment set the slinky in motion, and it\\'s been going ever since. From the very first cells, to you watching this now. At some point, you will merge with the rest of the dead universe again. Maybe you\\'ll tell it stories about your adventures. Maybe not. But before you find out, you get to do what life does best. Making a dead universe, much more interesting. (With a Supreme Slinky poster in your room.) *Quack* Duck: Why am I floating with no purpose in this universe?', \"In December 2019 the Chinese authorities notified the world that a virus was spreading through their communities. In the following months, it spread to other countries, with cases doubling within days. This virus is the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-Related Coronavirus 2 that causes the disease called Covid-19 and that everyone simply calls coronavirus. What actually happens when it infects a human and what should we all do? [Intro Music] A virus is really just a hull around genetic material and a few proteins, arguably not even a living thing. It can only make more of itself by entering a living cell. Corona may spread via surfaces, but it's still uncertain how long it can survive on them. Its main way of spreading seems to be droplet infection when people cough, or if you touch someone who's ill and then your face, say rubbing your eyes or nose. The virus starts its journey here, and then hitches a ride as a stowaway deeper into the body Its destinations are the intestines, the spleen or the lungs, where it can have the most dramatic effect. Even just a few corona viruses can cause quite a dramatic situation. The lungs are lined with billions of epithelial cells. These are the border cells of your body, lining your organs and mucosa waiting to be infected. Corona connects to a specific receptor on its victim's membranes to inject its genetic material. The cell, ignorant of what's happening, executes the new instructions, which are pretty simple: copy and reassemble. It fills up with more and more copies of the original virus until it reaches a critical point and receives one final order, self-destruct. The cell sort of melts away, releasing new corona particles ready to attack more cells. The number of infected cells grows exponentially After about 10 days, millions of body cells are infected, and billions of viruses swarmed the lungs. The virus has not caused too much damage yet, but corona is now going to release a real beast on you, your own immune system. The immune system, while there to protect you, can actually be pretty dangerous to yourself and needs tight regulation. And as immune cells pour into the lungs to fight the virus, Corona infects some of them and creates confusion. Cells have neither ears nor eyes. They communicate mostly via tiny information proteins called cytokines. Nearly every important immune reaction is controlled by them. Corona causes infected immune cells to overreact and yell bloody murder. In a sense, it puts the immune system into a fighting frenzy and sends way more soldiers than it should, wasting its resources and causing damage. Two kinds of cells in particular wreak havoc. First, neutrophils, which are great at killing stuff, including our cells. As they arrive in their thousands, they start pumping out enzymes that destroy as many friends as enemies. The other important type of cells that go into a frenzy are killer T-cells, which usually order infected cells to commit controlled suicide. Confused as they are, they start ordering healthy cells to kill themselves too. The more and more immune cells arrive, the more damage they do, and the more healthy lung tissue they kill. This might get so bad that it can cause permanent irreversible damage, that leads to lifelong disabilities. In most cases, the immune system slowly regains control. It kills the infected cells, intercepts the viruses trying to infect new ones and cleans up the battlefield. Recovery begins. The majority of people infected by Corona will get through it with relatively mild symptoms. But many cases become severe or even critical. We don't know the percentage because not all cases have been identified, but it's safe to say that there is a lot more than with the flu. In more severe cases, Millions of epithelial cells have died and with them, the lungs' protective lining is gone. That means that the alveoli - tiny air sacs via which breathing occurs - can be infected by bacteria that aren't usually a big problem. Patients get pneumonia. Respiration becomes hard or even fails, and patients need ventilators to survive. The immune system has fought at full capacity for weeks and made millions of antiviral weapons. And as thousands of bacteria rapidly multiply, it is overwhelmed. They enter the blood and overrun the body; if this happens, death is very likely. The Corona virus is often compared to the flu, but actually, it's much more dangerous. While the exact death rate is hard to pin down during an ongoing pandemic, we know for sure that it's much more contagious and spreads faster than the flu. There are two futures for a pandemic like Corona: fast and slow. Which future we will see depends on how we all react to it in the early days of the outbreak. A fast pandemic will be horrible and cost many lives; a slow pandemic will not be remembered by the history books. The worst case scenario for a fast pandemic begins with a very rapid rate of infection because there are no counter measures in place to slow it down. Why is this so bad? In a fast pandemic, many people get sick at the same time. If the numbers get too large, health care systems become unable to handle it. There aren't enough resources, like medical staff or equipment like ventilators, left to help everybody. People will die untreated. And as more health care workers get sick themselves, the capacity of health care systems falls even further. If this becomes the case, then horrible decisions will have to be made about who gets to live and who doesn't. The number of deaths rises significantly in such a scenario. To avoid this, the world - that means all of us - needs to do what it can to turn this into a slow pandemic. A pandemic is slowed down by the right responses. Especially in the early phase, so that everyone who gets sick can get treatment and there's no crunch point with overwhelmed hospitals. Since we don't have a vaccine for Corona, we have to socially engineer our behaviour, to act like a social vaccine. This simply means two things: 1. Not getting infected; and 2. Not infecting others. Although it sounds trivial, the very best thing you can do is to wash your hands. The soap is actually a powerful tool. The corona virus is encased in what is basically a layer of fat; soap breaks that fat apart and leaves it unable to infect you. It also makes your hands slippery, and with the mechanical motions of washing, viruses are ripped away. To do it properly, wash your hands as if you've just cut up some jalapeños and want to put in your contact lenses next. The next thing is social distancing, which is not a nice experience, but a nice thing to do. This means: no hugging, no handshakes. If you can stay at home, stay at home to protect those who need to be out for society to function: from doctors to cashiers, or police officers;. You depend on all of them; they all depend on you to not get sick. On a larger level, there are quarantines, which can mean different things, from travel restrictions or actual orders to stay at home. Quarantines are not great to experience and certainly not popular. But they buy us - and specially the researchers working on medication and vaccinations - crucial time So if you are put under quarantine, you should understand why, and respect it. None of this is fun. But looking at the big picture, it is a really small price to pay. The question of how pandemics end, depends on how they start; if they start fast with a steep slope, they end badly. If they start slow, with a not-so-steep slope, they end okay-ish. And, in this day and age, it really is in all of our hands. Literally, and figuratively. A huge thanks to the experts who helped us on short notice with this video, specially Our World In Data, the online publication for research and data on the world's largest problems and how to make progress solving them. Check out their site. It also includes a constantly updated page on the Corona pandemic [Outro music]\", 'Cancer is a creepy and mysterious thing. In the process of trying to understand it, to get better at killing it, we discovered a biological paradox\\nthat remains unsolved to this day: Large animals seem to be immune to cancer, which doesn\\'t make any sense. The bigger a being, the more cancer it should have. To understand why we first need to\\ntake a look at the nature of cancer itself. (Kurzgesagt intro music) Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell Our cells are protein robots made out\\nof hundreds of millions of parts. Guided only by chemical reactions, they create and dismantle structures, sustain a metabolism to gain energy, or make *almost* perfect copies of themselves. We call these complex chemical reactions pathways. They are biochemical networks upon networks,\\nintertwined and stacked on top of each other. Most of them can barely be comprehended by\\na single human mind and yet they functioned perfectly... Until.. they don\\'t. With billions of trillions of reactions happening\\nin thousands of networks over many years, The question is not *if* something\\nwill go wrong, but when. Tiny mistakes add up until the\\ngrandiose machinery gets corrupted. To prevent this from getting out of hand, our cells have kill switches that\\nmake them commit suicide. But these kill switches are not infallible. If they fail, a cell can turn into a cancer cell. Most of them are slained by\\nthe immune system very quickly. But this is a numbers game. Given enough time a cell would accrue enough mistakes, slipped by unnoticed and begin making more of itself. All animals have to deal with this problem. In general the cells of different\\nanimals are the same size. The cells of a mouse aren\\'t smaller than yours.\\nIt just has fewer cells in total and a shorter lifespan. Fewer cells and a short life means a lower chance\\nof things going wrong or cells mutating, or at least it should mean that. Humans live about 50 times longer and\\nhave 3!,000 times more cells than mice, yet the rate of cancer is basically\\nthe same in humans and in mice. Even waiter, blue whales with about 3,000 times more cells than humans don\\'t seem to get cancer at all really. This is PETO\\'S PARADOX: The baffling realization that large animals\\nhave much much less cancer than they should. Scientists think there are two main ways of\\nexplaining the paradox; evolution and hyper tumors. Solution one: evolve or become a blob of cancer. As multicellular beings\\ndeveloped a 600 million years ago, animals became bigger and bigger. Which added more and more cells and hence more\\nand more chances that cells could be corrupted. So the collective had to invest\\nin better and better cancer defenses. The ones that did not died out. But cancer doesn\\'t just happen. It\\'s a process that involves many individual mistakes and mutations in several specific genes within the same cell. These genes are called proto-oncogenes\\nand when they mutate it\\'s bad news. For example with the right mutation,\\na cell will lose its ability to kill itself. Another mutation and it will develop the ability to hide. Another and it will send out calls for resources. Another one and it will multiply quickly. These oncogenes have an antagonist though; tumor suppressor genes. They prevent these critical mutations from happening or order the cell to kill itself if they decide it\\'s beyond repair. It turns out that large animals\\nhave an increased number of them. Because of this, elephant cells require more\\nmutations than mice cells to develop a tumor. They are not immune but more resilient. This adaption probably comes with a cost in\\nsome form but researchers still aren\\'t sure what it is. Maybe tumor suppressors make elephants age quicker later in life or slow down how quickly injuries heal. We don\\'t know yet. But the solution to the paradox\\nmay actually be something different. \"Hypertumors\" Solution 2:  Hypertumors Solution 2: Hypertumors\\n(Yes) Solution 2: Hypertumors\\n(Yes, really.) Hypertumors are named after\\nhyperparasites: the parasites of parasites. Hypertumors are the tumors of tumors. Cancer can be thought of as\\na breakdown in cooperation. Normally, cells work together to form structures like organs, tissue or elements of the immune system. But cancer cells are selfish and only work for their own short-term benefit. If they\\'re successful, they form tumors;\\nhuge cancer collectives that can be very hard to kill. Making a tumor is hard work though. Millions or billions of cancer cells multiply rapidly,\\nwhich requires a lot of resources and energy. The amount of nutrients they can steal from\\nthe body becomes the limiting factor for growth. So the tumor cells trick the body to build new blood vessels directly to the tumor, to feed the thing killing it. And here, the nature of cancer cells\\nmay become their own undoing. Cancer cells are inherently unstable\\nand so they can continue to mutate. Some of them faster than their buddies. If they do this for a while, at some point one of the copies of\\nthe copies of the original cancer cell, might suddenly think of itself as an\\nindividual again and stop cooperating. Which means just like the body, the original tumor suddenly becomes an enemy, fighting for the same scarce nutrients and resources. So the newly mutated cells can create a hypertumor. Instead of helping, they cut off the\\nblood supply to their former buddies, which will starve and kill the original cancer cells. Cancer is killing cancer. This process can repeat over and over, and this may prevent cancer from\\nbecoming a problem for a large organism. It is possible that large animals have\\nmore of these hyper tumors than we realize, they might just not become big enough to notice Which makes sense a two gram tumor\\nis 10% of a mouse\\'s body weight, while It\\'s less than 0.002% of a human and 0.000002% of a blue whale. All three tumors require the same number of\\ncell divisions and have the same number of cells. So an old blue whale might be filled\\nwith tiny cancers and just not care. There are other proposed solutions to Peto\\'s paradox, such as different metabolic rates or different cellular architecture. But right now we just don\\'t know. Scientists are working on the problem. Figuring out how large animals are so resilient\\nto one of the most deadly diseases we know, could open the path to new therapies and treatments. Cancer has always been a challenge. Today, we are finally beginning to understand it and by doing so, one day we might finally overcome it.', \"For years, people have asked how we make our videos. So. let's finally talk about it. How to Make a Kurzgesagt Video in 1,200 Hours or More (Kurzgesagt intro) Kurzgesagt in a Nutshell But first things first, we need a topic. Our potential topic list is already endless, and every time we research something, it grows longer. So, we just work on whatever we find exciting at the time. This could be something serious, fascinating, personal, or just really stupid. The variety is half the fun. We want to explain complicated things in an easily graspable way and make science-y topics fascinating and beautiful. But we also want to tell stories and express how we feel about the universe from time to time. Laying the Foundation: Script Our research begins by reading books or scientific papers and by talking to different experts who point us in the right direction. We want to have a fact-based worldview and our videos are trying to reflect that. So we often have to change our view on an issue while working on it. Usually after a few weeks of researching we start writing. A script begins with a rough first draft that's then rewritten and edited over and over again. To make sure we don't misrepresent something, We asked experts to fact-check and correct us. Writing is the bottleneck for our videos, and very hard to speed up. Usually, finishing a script takes between a few weeks and literally years to complete. Let's Visualize: Illustration When the script is ready, we begin sketching out the video. We try to think of visual metaphors, transitions between ideas, and decide which scenes need the most attention. On average, 200 panels need to be illustrated in Adobe Illustrator. Although we have built up an illustration library, We still do most illustrations from scratch to give our videos a more unique look. The general idea is to find the right images to the words in the script to explain as clearly as possible, while also having interesting things to look at. Also, here we include all the visual easter eggs. In total, two to three illustrators spend 8 to 12 weeks illustrating the video. Now It's My Turn: Narration When the whole video is illustrated, the narration is recorded in a small recording studio on a Neumann TLM 103 microphone and Pro Tools It's important to keep the flow, so I try to get one version done and then go back through, retaking paragraphs and sentences Until they feel right and a full version is ready. It's Alive: Animation Now the scenes and audio need to be animated. We make things move in Adobe After Effects and recently, we've begun experimenting with Cinema 4D. The first thing to do is take the illustrated scenes apart and organize them. The hundreds or thousands of parts are then imported into After Effects. Each character is rigged, so we can move them more naturally. Aside from a few plugins that help us save time, every single thing that's moving on-screen has been moved manually. So, two to three animators animate scene after scene for about eight to ten weeks in total. Ending On a High Note: Music and Sound Design The final step is the music. Every song is original music composed to the finished video to create a unique atmosphere and to highlight the important parts. You can listen to all of the songs on SoundCloud and Spotify. The icing on the cake are the sound effects. Many of you might not even really notice them, which is a shame because they really add an additional layer. So, try watching a video with headphones if you want to get the full depth of it. All of these steps happen in parallel, since we usually work on two to four videos at the same time in various stages. What we haven't mentioned are the countless revisions and edits. Every few days, we sit together and review our work and tweak it until it feels just right. And that's it - at least 1,200 hours for a single Kurzgesagt video. As you can imagine, making videos for thousands of hours as a big team and then putting them on the internet for free is a weird business model. Over the years, we've relied on a number of different things to stay afloat. Commercial work for NGOs, startups, or corporations Sponsorships and grants by companies or organizations. We struck a deal with Funk from German public broadcasting to revive the German channel and with Wix to start a Spanish channel. But the reality is, we can only do what we do because of you. Our two most important sources of income by far come from your direct support, merchandise and Patreon. So, if you want to help us stay afloat and keep making more videos, You can directly support Kurzgesagt by getting something beautiful from our store, or by becoming a patreon and joining the bird army. Don't feel obligated though. Watching, engaging, or sharing our videos is already helping us a lot. But if you want to support us directly, thank you so much. You're making our videos free for everyone. You are enabling us to practice and improve, to stay independent and to work on ambitious projects that would be too scary or too big otherwise. Kurzgesagt did not start with an end goal in mind. It began as a personal project because it felt good to make something with time and love, and this is still true today. Making these videos is our goal. Doing the work every day and getting better. To make science beautiful and interesting.

(Nice music) (Kurzgesagt outro)\", \"Over the last decade, milk has become a bit controversial. Some people say it's a necessary and nutritious food, vital for healthy bones, but others say it can cause cancer and lead to an early death. So, who's right? And why are we drinking it anyway? [Intro music] Milk is the basis of every mammal's diet after birth, when our digestive systems are immature and small. Basically, it's power food to kick-start our bodies and help us grow. Milk is rich in fat, vitamins, minerals, and milk-sugar: lactose. On top of that, for a while after birth, it also contains antibodies and proteins that protect us from infections and regulate our immune system. But it's a lot of effort for mothers to produce. Eventually, humans stop drinking mother's milk and transition to the diet of their parents. This is how it's been for thousands of years. Until about eleven thousand years ago, when our ancestors settled down in the first agricultural communities. Soon, they domesticated the first dairy animals: goats, sheep, and cattle. They found that dairy animals are able to eat useless and abundant stuff and turn it into nutritious and tasty food. This made a huge difference in terms of survival, especially in hard times. So groups that had milk available had an evolutionary advantage. And through natural selection, it changed the genes of communities who consumed a lot of it. This adaptation has to do with a specialized enzyme: lactase. Babies have a lot of it in their system, so they can break down the milk-sugar lactose and digest milk easily. But the older we grow, the fewer lactase enzymes our body produces. Worldwide, about 65% of the population do not have the enzyme after infancy, which means they are not able to digest more than about 150 milliliters each day. This lactose intolerance is not spread evenly around the world, though. In some East Asian communities, for example, it's up to 90%. In Northern Europe and North America, the rates are the lowest overall. There are probably a few reasons for this uneven distribution. The trait was first introduced by random mutation, which happened independently of each other in a few populations. The fact that farming replaced hunting and gathering more and more created natural-selection pressure. People who were able to digest lactose had more foods at hand, which was an advantage. The migration of dairy farmers to the north then spread it further, which probably pushed back populations there that didn't have the trait. Okay, but if milk has been a valuable part of our diet for thousands of years, why is it so controversial? There are a number of claims regarding the negative and positive health effects of milk. The negative ones cover a wide variety, from brittle bones to cancer, and cardiovascular diseases to intolerance and allergies. So, how do they hold up? Some older studies found a connection between milk and a high risk of breast, colon, and prostate cancer But meta analyses found no impact on your cancer risk. On the contrary, the calcium in milk might even have a protective effect against colon cancer. Although this could be calcium in general, it's not clear milk plays a role in this effect. Only studies on prostate cancer showed an increased risk for people who consumed more than one and a quarter liters of milk a day. But again, the association is inconsistent and other studies don't find any effects. We discuss these studies in more detail in our sources document. All in all, the research seems to show that if you drink between 100 to 250 milliliters of milk per day, cancer is not a concern. Similarly, meta-analyses could not find any impact from milk or dairy products on your risk of heart disease, stroke, or your total mortality. Some studies even suggested that high blood pressure might be rarer in people who eat a lot of dairy, although the evidence is not strong enough to claim this with confidence. The case gets more complicated though when we look at bones. A number of studies found neither positive nor negative effects for adults. What most people worry most about though are harmful amounts of pesticides, antibiotics, or hormones. There are hormones in milk, but only in very low concentrations. For example to get the same amount of hormones as from the pill, you'd need to drink about 5000 litres of milk, and even if you did, most hormones would be destroyed by your digestive system before they could affect you, which is the reason why so much medication is coated to protect it from our digestion. For pesticides and antibiotics, there are regulations in most parts of the world that only allow completely harmless amounts. Milk that surpasses these thresholds is not allowed to go on the shelf. So there's nothing in particular to worry about. Besides allergies and those suffering from lactose intolerances, the best known negative effects of milk are probably acne and general discomfort after drinking milk or eating dairy products, and here the effects are very real. For example, skimmed milk has been found to statistically increase the rate of acne by 24%. Allergies against milk products are especially prevalent among children, with one in 18 kids in Germany suffering from them. In general, these allergies tend to get better or disappear as they grow older though. Okay. Is milk healthy then? Milk, no matter if it comes from mothers, cows, sheep, goats, or camels is a nutrient-dense food. It contains all necessary macronutrients and many micronutrients. Especially in regions where people struggle to get enough calories, milk can contribute to a healthy life and lower child mortality. For those living in the developed world, in general milk is not harmful if you are not allergic or intolerant to it. Especially for children, it's a good way to get large amounts of calcium and for vegetarians, it's a good source of vitamin b12 and B vitamins in general. This does not mean there are not other alternatives with the same effect. You do not need to drink milk to be healthy Milk is also definitely not a substitute for water. Milk is power food, and the additional calories from drinking a lot of it on a regular basis can contribute to being overweight. Especially flavored milk or chocolate milk is more comparable to beverages like lemonade than a healthy snack, and there's another thing to consider. Milk production has a significant impact on the global climate. About 33 percent of cropland is used to feed grazing animals including dairy cattle Even though the carbon footprint of dairy products has declined since 1990, Dairy production is still responsible for 3 percent of all greenhouse gas emissions, even more than all airplanes combined. Milk is a huge industry and sadly, most of its production in factory farms causes incredible suffering. Cows are impregnated over and over, separated from their young shortly after birth, and slaughtered once their tortured bodies are not productive anymore. We can't ignore that much of the milk we consume stems from an industry that is basically torture and contributes to climate change. What about plant-based milk? In terms of protein levels and nutritional value, only soy milk can compare to cow milk. The others need to be artificially enriched to reach similar levels of vitamins and calcium. So they can be an alternative to milk. And another option might be available soon. Several startups have created non-animal milk that is nutritionally identical to dairy milk, for example, through fermentation by gene modified bacteria. This lab-grown milk can even be turned into cheese, something that plant based alternatives struggle with because they lack casein and whey protein, the key ingredients that give dairy its taste and structure. The environmental impact is a different story though. Many milk alternatives use significantly less energy, land and less water to produce so they have a much lower environmental impact than animal milk. If you want to have the lowest possible negative impact on the planet, the best choice is whatever milk alternative is regional. As with almost any topic milk is complicated. It's not harmful for the majority of the population and it's crucial for many people around the world. It's good, nutritious food, but also harmful to the planet and causes a lot of suffering. We need to decide as a society how we want to deal with these facts.\", \"Nothing in the universe is static. In the Milky Way, billions of stars orbit the galactic center. Some, like our Sun, are pretty consistent, keeping a distance of around 30,000 light years from the galactic center, completing an orbit every 230 million years. This dance is not an orderly ballet, more like a skating rink filled with drunk toddlers. This chaos makes the galaxy dangerous. Our solar neighborhood is constantly changing, with stars moving hundreds of kilometers every second. Only the vast distances between objects protect us from the dangers out there. But we might get unlucky in the future. At some point, we could encounter a star going supernova or a massive object passing by and showering Earth with asteroids. If something like this were to happen, we would likely know thousands if not millions of years in advance. But we still couldn't do much about it. Unless, we move our whole solar system out of the way. [Snazzy Kurzgesagt intro music] To move the solar system, we need a stellar engine, a megastructure used to steer a star through the galaxy. It's the kind of thing that might be built by an advanced civilization with Dyson sphere-level technology that's thinking about their future millions of years ahead of time. But how do we possibly move the hundreds of thousands of objects in the solar system? The good news is we can ignore all of that. We only need to move the Sun; all the other stuff is glued to it by gravity and will follow it wherever it decides to go. There are lots of ideas about what a stellar engine might look like and how it would work. We've picked two, grounded in our current understanding of physics, that could be built in theory. The simplest kind of stellar engine is the Shkadov thruster, a giant mirror. It works on the same principle as a rocket. Like rocket fuel, the photons released as solar radiation carry momentum, not a lot but a bit. For example, if an astronaut turned on a flashlight in space, it would push them backwards very very slowly. A stellar engine will work a little better than a flashlight because the Sun produces a lot of photons. The basic idea of the Shkadov thruster is to reflect up to half of the solar radiation to create thrust, and slowly push the Sun where we want it to go. In order for the Shkadov thruster to work, it must be kept in the same place, not orbiting the Sun. Although the Sun's gravity will try to pull it in, it would be supported by radiation pressure which props the mirror up. This means the mirror would have to be very light, made of micron thin reflecting foil from materials like aluminium alloys. The mirror's shape is important too, enveloping the Sun in a giant spherical shell wouldn't work because that would refocus light back to the Sun, heating it up and creating all sorts of unpleasant problems. Instead we use a parabola, which sends most of the photons around the Sun and in the same direction, which maximizes thrust. To prevent accidentally burning or freezing Earth with too much or too little sunlight, the only safe place to build a Shkadov thruster is over the Sun's poles. This means we can only move the Sun vertically in the plane of the solar system and one direction in the Milky Way, which limits our travel options abate. But that is basically it. For a civilization capable of building a Dyson Sphere, this is a relatively simple endeavor. Not complicated, just very hard to build. At full throttle, the solar system could probably be moved by about a hundred light years over 230 million years. Over a few billion years, it gives us near complete control over the sun's orbit in the galaxy. But in the short term, this might not be fast enough to dodge a deadly supernova. That's why we thought we could do better. So we asked our astrophysicist friend if he could design a faster stellar engine for this video. He did and wrote a paper about it that's been published in a peer-reviewed journal. You can find it in our sources document. We're going to call at our new stellar engine the Caplan thruster. It works a lot like a traditional rocket: shoot exhaust one way to push yourself the other. It's a large space station platform powered by a Dyson sphere that gathers matter from the Sun to power nuclear fusion. It shoots out a very fast jet of particles at nearly 1 percent the speed of light out of the solar system. A second jet pushes the Sun along like a tugboat. The Caplan thruster requires a lot of fuel, millions of tons per second. To gather this fuel, our thruster uses very large electromagnetic fields to funnel hydrogen and helium from the solar wind into the engine. The solar wind alone doesn't provide enough fuel though, and that's where the Dyson sphere comes in. Using its power, sunlight can be refocused to the surface of the Sun. This heats small regions to extreme temperatures, lifting billions of tons of mass off the Sun. This mass can be collected and separated into hydrogen and helium. The helium is burned explosively in thermonuclear fusion reactors. A jet of Radioactive oxygen at a temperature of nearly a billion degrees is expelled and becomes our primary source of propulsion from our stellar engine. To prevent the engine from just crashing into the Sun, it needs to balance itself. To do this, We accelerate the collected hydrogen with electromagnetic fields using particle accelerators and shoot a jet back at the Sun. This balances the thruster and transfers the thrust of our engine back to the Sun. In as little as a million years, this engine can move the Sun by 50 light years, more than enough to dodge a supernova. At full throttle, the solar system can be completely redirected in its galactic orbit in 10 million years. But wait, will we use up the Sun this way? Fortunately the Sun is so massive that even billions of tons of material will barely scratch the surface. In fact, this megastructure will actually extend our Sun's life, since lower mass stars burn slower, keeping the solar system inhabitable for many more billions of years. With a Caplan thruster, we could turn the entire solar system into our spaceship. For example, by orbiting backwards in the galaxy and colonizing hundreds or thousands of stars as we pass by them. It may even be possible to escape the galaxy entirely and expand beyond the Milky Way. Stellar engines are the kind of machines built by civilizations thinking not in terms of years or decades but eons. Since we know that our Sun will die one day, a stellar engine could allow the far future descendants of humans to travel to other stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space. Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the Galactic sea. We may not like where it leads us. Maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come. This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era, and what a year it was. So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people. Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle. We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope. The world is screwed up, But we can fix it. In a few days, this year will be over, and we'll get to try again. Thank you for watching our videos, and for sticking around for so many years. See you all in 12,020.\", \"For most of our history, the human population grew slowly, until new discoveries brought us more food, and made us live longer. In just a hundred years, the human population quadrupled. This led to apocalyptic visions of an overcrowded earth. But the population growth rate actually peaked in the 1960s. Since then, fertility rates have crashed as countries industrialize and develop. The world population is now expected to balance out at around 11 billion by the end of the century. But the big picture conceals the details. Let's look at one region in particular. Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2019, it was home to a billion people living in 46 countries. Although its growth rate has slowed down in the last few decades, it's still much higher than in the rest of the world. While some projections expect around 2.6 billion people, others reckon with up to 5 billion by 2100. Such growth would be a huge challenge for any society. But Sub-Saharan Africa is also the poorest region on earth. So, is Sub-Saharan Africa doomed? And, why did the projections vary by 2.4 billion people? As always, it's complicated. Sub-Saharan Africa is a made-up idea, and in many ways, unhelpful one. Botswana is as far away from Sierra Leone, as Ireland is from Kazakhstan. And they have about as much in common. But without generalizing a little bit, this video would be an hour long! We've also talked to many different scientists for this video, and they disagreed on a lot of things. Mainly, on how much fertility matters to poverty. We've done our best to summarize our research and what they told us, but take it with a grain of salt, and check out our sources when we discussed this in more detail. Okay, let's zoom out to the global perspective again. A few decades ago, many countries in Asia were at a similar point to Sub-Saharan Africa today. Large parts of the population were living in extreme poverty, and birth rates were very high. Take Bangladesh. In the 1960s, the average woman had 7 children in her lifetime. 25% of them died before they turned 5, and of the ones that survived, only one of five would learn to read and write. Life expectancy was about 45, and per capita income was among the lowest in the world. So, beginning in the 1960s, Bangladesh started a family planning program, based on three main pillars. 1. Education helped to change women's outlook. Women with a higher education tend to want fewer kids, and become mothers later in life. 2. Better health care lowered child mortality, leading to parents' wanting fewer children, because they could expect them to survive. 3. Field workers brought contraceptives even to the remotest areas, which drove contraceptive use from 8% in 1975, to 76% in 2019. Together, these measures greatly slowed down population growth. In 1960, the average Bangladeshi women had 7 kids. In 1995, 4, and, in 2019, it was down to 2. This also changed the country's demographics and the economy. Before, many children were born, but died before they got to contribute to society. As far fewer kids die and fewer kids are born, things change. Kids get an education, and turn into productive adults. The government was able to shift some of their resources from lowering child mortality to boosting the economy. By 2024, Bangladesh is expected to graduate from the category of least developed countries to the status of a developing economy. Other Asian countries like South Korea, India, Thailand or the Philippines have gone through a similar process, often even faster. Investment in health and education led to lower birth rates, which changed the composition of the population, and enabled governments to boost the economy. Why didn't the same thing happen everywhere in Sub-Saharan Africa? Africa, as a whole, has made considerable progress with childhood mortality. but especially in Sub-Saharan Africa, education has improved slower than in other parts of the world. And, while in total, contraceptive use has doubled in the region since 1990, the unmet need for modern contraception among adolescents is still at about 60%. The reasons for this are complicated, and it's impossible to give a single answer here. Africa is a big place with diverse cultures and people. But there are a few main factors. Many Sub-Saharan Nations have suffered under colonization until only a few decades ago, and had rough transition periods towards independence. The young nations were often ethnically heterogeneous and lacked unity. Some areas have been repeatedly racked by civil wars, military conflicts or suffered under unstable governments, which made it really hard to expand infrastructure and health care. So, Africa had a worse starting point than Asia. Foreign aid and how it was applied, especially during the cold war, is also a contentious issue. But this topic is too complex to summarize in a few sentences, so we'll make a whole new video about it in the future. And lastly, there are cultural aspects that make talking about family plan in the context of Africa difficult. Critics say that trying to bring fertility down is an intrusion into culture and tradition. But not speaking about an issue will not help solve it. Not all of these things apply to every country in the region. We're talking about 46 countries after all, some of them deeply troubled, others already flourishing, all different and facing unique problems. If population growth continues at its present rate, then Sub-Saharan Africa could grow to more than 4 billion people by 2100. Okay. So, what can be done? Actually, a lot! Especially, investment and aid that helped to build systems for education, family planning, and health care. Surprisingly small changes could have an extreme impact. For example, if women get a better education, and have their first child just two years later in life. This tiny gap between this generation and the next one would lead to 400 million fewer people in 2100, with 3.6 billion in total. If education and family planning are made available to every African women, universal access to contraception makes having kids a decision. If families get to choose how many kids they want, birth projections fall by 30%, to 2.8. billion people. This isn't just theory. There are already examples that are reason for optimism. Ethiopia, the African country with the second-biggest population, has made a lot of progress in a relatively short amount of time. Improving health services lead to a drop in child mortality from 20% to 7% since 1990. And up to 30% of the annual budget was invested in education, and the number of schools increased 25-fold over two decades. So, summarizing, there are serious challenges ahead, but they are far from unsolvable. Sub-Saharan Africa does not need pity or gifts, but attention and fair investment. It's a region rich in resources, culture, and potential. If things go right, we'll see a turn-around similar to the one we've seen across most of Asia in the last 30 years. (quack)\", 'Everybody is familiar with the feeling that things are not as they should be. That you\\'re not successful enough, your relationship\\'s not satisfying enough, that you don\\'t have the things you crave. A chronic dissatisfaction that makes you look outwards with envy and inwards with disappointment. Pop culture, advertising, and social media make this worse by reminding you that aiming for anything less than your dream job is failure, you need to have great experiences constantly, be conventionally attractive, have a lot of friends, and find your soulmate, and that others have all of these things and are truly happy. And, of course, a vast array of self-improvement products implies that it\\'s all your fault for not working hard enough on yourself. In the last two decades, researchers have been starting to investigate how we can counteract these impulses. The field of positive psychology emerged, the study of what makes life worth living, while cognitive behavioral therapy was developed to change negative feelings. Scientists began to ask \"Why are some people happier and more satisfied than others?\" \"And are there ways to apply what they\\'re doing right to the rest of us?\" In this video, we want to talk about one of the strongest predictors of how happy people are, how easily they make friends, and how good they are at dealing with hardship. An antidote to dissatisfaction, so to speak: Gratitude. While gratitude may sound like another self-improvement trend, preached by people\\nwho use hashtags, what we currently know about it is based\\non a body of scientific work and studies. We\\'ll include them in the description. Gratitude can mean very different things\\nto different people in different contexts. It\\'s a character trait, a feeling,\\na virtue, and a behavior. You can feel grateful towards someone\\nwho did something for you, for random events,\\nlike the weather, or even for nature or fate, and it\\'s wired into our biology. 1: How Gratitude Connects Us to Each Other. The predecessor of gratitude\\nis probably reciprocity. It likely evolved as\\na biological signal that motivates animals to exchange\\nthings for their mutual benefit and can be found\\nin the animal kingdom among certain fish,\\nbirds, or mammals, but especially in primates. When your brain recognizes that\\nsomeone\\'s done something nice for you, it reacts with gratitude to\\nmotivate you to repay them. This gratitude makes\\nyou care about others, and others care about you. This was important because, as human brains got\\nbetter at reading emotions, selfish individuals were\\nidentified and shunned. It became an evolutionary advantage\\nto play well with others and build lasting relationships. For example,\\nif you were hungry and someone else showed\\nyou where to find tasty berries, you felt gratitude towards them and a bond to return\\nthe favor in the future, a drive to be pro-social. When you repaid them,\\nthey felt gratitude towards you. This brought your ancestors\\ncloser together and forged bonds and friendships. So, early forms of gratitude\\nwere biological mechanisms that modified your behavior\\ntowards cooperation, which helped humans\\nto dominate Earth. But, over time, gratitude became more than\\njust an impulse to play fair. 2: The Consequences of Gratitude Scientists found that gratitude\\nstimulates the pathways in your brain involved in feelings of reward, forming social bonds, and interpreting other\\'s intentions. It also makes it easier to save\\nand retrieve positive memories Even more, gratitude directly counteracts\\nnegative feelings and traits, like envy and social comparison, narcissism, cynicism, and materialism. As a consequence, people who\\nare grateful, no matter what for, tend to be happier and more satisfied. They have better relationships, an easier time making friends. They sleep better, tend to suffer less from\\ndepression, addiction, and burnout, and are better at dealing\\nwith traumatic events. In a way, gratitude makes it\\nless likely that you\\'ll fall into one of the psychological traps\\nmodern life has set for you. For example, gratitude\\nmeasurably counters the tendency to forget and\\ndownplay positive events. If you work long and\\nhard for something, actually getting it can feel\\ndaft and empty. You can find yourself emotionally\\nback where you started and try to achieve\\nthe next biggest thing, looking for that satisfaction, instead of being satisfied with yourself. Or, imagine being lonely and\\nwanting to have more friends. You actually might have someone or even multiple people\\nwho want to hang out, but you might feel that\\nthis is not enough, that you\\'re a loser and\\nfeel bad about yourself. So you might turn down\\ntheir attempts to hang out and become more lonely. If you feel grateful for\\nyour relationships instead, you might accept invitations or even take the initiative. The more often you risk opening up, the higher the chance of\\nsolidifying relationships and meeting new people. In the best case, gratitude\\ncan trigger a feedback loop. Positive feelings lead to\\nmore pro-social behavior, which leads to more\\npositive social experiences that cause more\\npositive feelings. This is a common experience\\nafter serious hardship, like chemotherapy, for example. Life can feel amazing\\nafter a crisis is over. The smallest things can be\\nbottomless sources of joy, from being able to taste to just sitting in the sun\\nor chatting with a friend. Objectively, your life is the same or\\nmaybe even slightly worse than before, but your brain compares\\nyour present experiences with the times\\nwhen life was bad and reacts with gratitude. So, in a nutshell, gratitude refocuses your attention\\ntowards the good things you have, and the consequences of this shift are better feelings and\\nmore positive experiences. While it is great to\\nknow these things, is there actually a way for\\nyou to feel more of it? 3: How To Make Your Brain More Grateful The ability to experience\\nmore or less gratitude is not equally distributed. You have what\\'s known as\\ntrait gratitude, that determines how much\\nyou are able to feel it. It depends on your genetics,\\npersonality, and culture. This discovery made\\nscientists wonder if they could design exercises\\nthat change your trait gratitude and lead to more happiness. Let\\'s start with\\nimportant caveats. It\\'s not yet entirely clear to what degree\\ngratitude can be trained or how long the effects last. There are no\\nmagic pills for happiness. Life is complicated. On some days, it feels like\\nyou\\'re in control of yourself, and, on others, you\\nfeel like you\\'re not. And this is okay. Also, sometimes pursuing happiness\\ncan make you more unhappy if you put too much pressure on yourself. Gratitude should also not be seen\\nas a solution to depression or a substitute for professional help,. It can only be a piece of the puzzle. It\\'s not the solution to the puzzle itself. The easiest gratitude exercise,\\nwith the most solid research behind it, is gratitude journaling. It means sitting down\\nfor a few minutes, one to three times a week, and writing down five to ten\\nthings you\\'re grateful for It might feel weird at first, so start simply. Can you feel grateful\\nfor a little thing? Like how great coffee is, or that someone\\nwas kind to you. Can you appreciate something\\nsomeone else did for you? Can you reflect on which things or people\\nyou would miss if they were gone and be grateful that they\\'re in your life? We\\'re all different, so you\\'ll know what\\nworks for you. And that\\'s it, really. It feels almost insulting, like things shouldn\\'t\\nbe that simple. But in numerous studies, the participants reported\\nmore happiness and a higher general\\nlife satisfaction after doing this practice\\nfor a few weeks. And, even more, studies have found \\nchanges in brain activity some months\\nafter they ended. Practicing gratitude may be\\na real way to reprogram yourself. This research shows that\\nyour emotions are not fixed. In the end, how\\nyou experience life is a representation of\\nwhat you believe about it. If you attack your core beliefs\\nabout yourself and your life, you can change your\\nthoughts and feelings, which automatically\\nchanges your behavior. It\\'s pretty mind-blowing that\\nsomething as simple as self-reflection can hack the pathways in our brain\\nto fight dissatisfaction. And, if this is no reason\\nto be more optimistic, what is? Being a human is hard, but it doesn\\'t need\\nto be as hard. And, if you actively look, you might find that your life is\\nmuch better than you thought. [Happy bark] [Party horn] If you\\'re curious and\\nwant to try out gratitude, we made a thing. Please note that you don\\'t need to buy\\nanything from anyone to practice gratitude. All you need is paper,\\na pen, and five minutes. Having said that, we\\'ve made\\na Kurzgesagt gratitude journal, based on studies we\\'ve read, conversations with experts, and our personal experiences\\nwith gratitude over the last year. It\\'s structured in a way that\\nmight make it a bit easier to get into the habit of\\ngratitude journaling. There are short explanations\\nand reflections to mix it up and make it more interesting. We\\'ve also made it\\nas pretty as we could. This video continues\\nthe unofficial series of more personal,\\nintrospective videos, from optimistic nihilism to\\nloneliness and now gratitude. We don\\'t want to be\\na self-help channel, so we\\'ll keep this sort of video\\nat roughly one per year. We hope they\\'re helpful\\nto some of you. Thank you for watching. [Outro theme] [Quack]\\n[Outro theme] [Outro theme]', \"Getting to space is hard. Right now, it’s like going up on a mountain on a unicycle- with a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can’t transport a lot of stuff, and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity about 40,000km an hour to escape from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel with a tiny tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planets, because you need a lot of heavy stuff if you want to survive, and maybe even come back. So, is there a way to get to space with less fuel and more payload? A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure. Whether it’s roads for cars, ports for ships, or rails for trains, we’ve made it easier to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars, and beyond easier and cheaper. Great, but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science, magic materials, or huge investments, and that has been tested successfully in orbit already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple; it’s surprising. What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long — into space, and had spacecraft use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the Skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. A counterweight holds a long cable in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more-or-less for free, equal to twice the tether’s rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a Skyhook would be faced with. To protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into a web of redundant fibres. Since our Skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a day, this would allow small, reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it’s not that easy. At its lowest point, the tether’s tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around 12,000km/h. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can’t lower the Skyhook too much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers and no lower. To match this, we’ll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While this isn't exactly easy, it’s still much cheaper than getting a big tin can, filled with rocket fuel, to go 40,000km/h. Catching the tip will be a challenge too. There’s only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky, moving at Mach 12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line a kilometer long with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge is keeping our Skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up, they use up the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don’t do anything, it will slow down and crash into the atmosphere. And here, we can cheat the universe a bit. The Skyhook is a battery of orbital energy. It’s possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off. Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to earth add energy to the tether, which it can give to other ships departing into space. This way, the tether doesn’t lose any energy. The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we’re still losing energy with each boost, we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct the tether’s position. A set of tethers, one around earth and one around Mars, could make trips between the planets fast, straight-forward and low cost compared to rockets. The Earth tether would sit in low earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to Mars. The Mars tether catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In the opposite direction, the tether could pick up a vehicle travelling through Mars’ thin atmosphere at only about 1,000km/h not much faster than our airliners on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down. The tethers could shorten trips between both planets, from nine months down to five or even three, and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96 percent. Even better: people may be able to travel in relative luxury as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort. Tether travel would be first-class seats to Mars! Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable. But let’s go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt. The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination. Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free. Getting to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system. Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the solar system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don’t need to worry about slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for super-tethers just under 6,000km long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch. The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same super-tether can also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single swing away. Unlike Mars, they’re bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals. In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellent transport network for the terrestrial planets, centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably cheap and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar system accessible for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to build them today, there’s really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system are far away, but they could be very close.\", 'Neutron stars are one of the most extreme and violent things in the universe. Giant atomic nuclei, only a few kilometers in diameter, but as massive as stars. And they owe their existence to the death of something majestic. [Intro music] Stars exist because of a fragile balance. The mass of millions of billions of trillions of tons of hot plasma are being pulled inwards by gravity, and squeeze material together with so much force that nuclei fuse Hydrogen fuses into helium. This releases energy which pushes against gravity and tries to escape. As long as this balance exists, stars are pretty stable. Eventually, the hydrogen will be exhausted. Medium stars, like our Sun, go through a giant phase, where they burn helium into carbon and oxygen before they eventually turn into white dwarfs. But in stars many times the mass of our Sun, things get interesting when the helium is exhausted. For a moment, the balance of pressure and radiation tips, and gravity wins, squeezing the star tighter than before. The core burns hotter and faster, while the outer layers of the star swell by hundreds of times, fusing heavier and heavier elements. Carbon burns to neon in centuries, neon to oxygen in a year, oxygen to silicon in months, and silicon to iron in a day. And then… …death. Iron is nuclear ash. It has no energy to give and cannot be fused. The fusion suddenly stops, and the balance ends. Without the outward pressure from fusion, the core is crushed by the enormous weight of the star above it. What happens now is awesome and scary. Particles, like electrons and protons, really don’t want to be near each other. But the pressure of the collapsing star is so great that electrons and protons fuse into neutrons, which then get squeezed together as tightly as in atomic nuclei. An iron ball, the size of the Earth, is squeezed into a ball of pure nuclear matter, the size of a city. But not just the core; The whole star implodes, gravity pulling the outer layers in at 25% the speed of light. This implosion bounces off the iron core, producing a shock wave that explodes outwards and catapults the rest of the star into space. This is what we call a supernova explosion, and it will outshine entire galaxies. What remains of the star is now a neutron star. Its mass is around a million times the mass of the Earth but compressed to an object about 25 kilometers wide. It’s so dense that the mass of all living humans would fit into one cubic centimeter of neutron star matter. That’s roughly a billion tons in a space the size of a sugar cube. Put another way, that’s Mount Everest in a cup of coffee. From the outside, a neutron star is unbelievably extreme. Its gravity is the strongest, outside black holes, and, if it were any denser, it would become one. Light is bent around it, meaning you can see the front and parts of the back. Their surfaces reach 1,000,000 degrees Celsius, compared to a measly 6,000 degrees for our Sun. Okay, let’s look inside a neutron star. Although these giant atomic nuclei are stars, in many ways, they’re also like planets, with solid crusts over a liquid core. The crust is extremely hard. The outermost layers are made of iron left over from the supernova, squeezed together in a crystal lattice, with a sea of electrons flowing through them. Going deeper, gravity squeezes nuclei closer together. We find fewer and fewer protons, as most merge to neutrons. Until we reach the base of the crust. Here, nuclei are squeezed together so hard that they start to touch. Protons and neutrons rearrange, making long cylinders or sheets, enormous nuclei with millions of protons and neutrons shaped like spaghetti and lasagna, which physicists call nuclear pasta. Nuclear pasta is so dense that it may be the strongest material in the universe, basically unbreakable. Lumps of pasta inside a neutron star can even make mountains at most a few centimeters high, but many times as massive as the Himalayas. Eventually, beneath the pasta, we reach the core. We’re not really sure what the properties of matter are when they’re squeezed this hard. Protons and neutrons might dissolve into an ocean of quarks, a so-called quark-gluon plasma. Some of those quarks might turn into strange quarks, making a sort of strange matter, with properties so extreme, that we made a whole video about it. Or, maybe they just stay protons and neutrons. No one knows for sure, and that’s why we do science. That’s all pretty heavy stuff, literally, so let’s go back out into space. When neutron stars first collapse, they begin to spin very, very fast, like a ballerina pulling her arms in. Neutron stars are celestial ballerinas, spinning many times per second. This creates pulses because their magnetic field creates a beam of radio waves, which passes every time they spin. These radio pulsars are the best-known type of neutron star. About 2,000 are known of in the Milky Way. These magnetic fields are the strongest in the universe, a quadrillion times stronger than Earth’s after they’re born. They’re called magnetars until they calm down a little. But the absolute best kind of neutron stars are friends with other neutron stars. By radiating away energy as gravitational waves, ripples in spacetime, their orbits can decay, and they can crash into and kill each other in a kilonova explosion that spews out a lot of their guts. When they do, the conditions become so extreme that, for a moment, heavy nuclei are made again. It’s not fusion putting nuclei together this time, but heavy neutron-rich matter falling apart and reassembling. Only very recently, we’ve learned that this is probably the origin of most of the heavy elements in the universe, like gold, uranium, and platinum, and dozens more. So there now two neutron stars collapse and become a black hole, dying yet again. Not only do stars have to die to create elements, they have to die twice. Over millions of years, these atoms will mix back into the galaxy, but some of them end up in a cloud, which gravity pulls together to form stars and planets, repeating the cycle. Our solar system is one example, and the remains of those neutron stars that came before us are all around us. Our entire technological modern world was built out of the elements neutron stars made in eons past, sending these atoms on a thirteen-billion-year journey to come together and make us and our world. And that’s pretty cool.', \"Playing around with nuclear weapons in videos is fun. There's a visceral joy in blowing things up, and a horrifying fascination with things\\nlike fireballs, shockwaves, and radiation. And while it does help put our destructive\\npower in perspective, it's not the best way of understanding \\nthe real impact of a nuclear explosion. This isn't about silly stacks of TNT, or about how bright an explosion is. Nuclear weapons are about you. So we've partnered with the Red Cross\\nand Red Crescent movement to explore what would really happen if a nuclear weapon were detonated in a major city today. Not nuclear war, just one explosion. *Kurzgesagt Intro Music* We begin our story in the middle of\\ndowntown in a major city. People are going to work, studying for exams, are lost in their thoughts and daily lives. Right here a nuclear weapon is detonated\\nand time freezes. The first phase of the explosion happens\\nwithin less than a second. In a millisecond, a ball of plasma hotter than the Sun appears and grows in a fireball to more than 2 kilometres across. Within this ball, everyone is just gone. Think of water dripped on to a very hot pan. A sizzle, and then there's nothing. Most buildings, cars, trees, \\ntacky sculptures and people... ... all evaporated. First, the flash: an intense tsunami of light washes over the city in an instant. If you happen to have your head pointed in the direction of the explosion, it renders you blind for a few hours. The heat of this light produces a thermal pulse, so energetic and hot that it just burns everything as far as 13 kilometres from the detonation site. What this means is that everything in an area of 500 square kilometres that is able to burn, starts burning. Plastic, wood, fabric, hair, and skin. If you happen to be in reach of the thermal pulse, one moment, you're on your way to work, the next moment, you're on fire. Now the second phase begins. It happens in a few seconds. Most people will now first notice\\nthat something is wrong, but it's already too late for hundreds of thousands. The flash is followed by the shockwave. The heat and radiation of the fireball create a bubble of superheated and super-compressed air around it that's now expanding explosively. Faster than the speed of sound, creating winds stronger than hurricanes and tornadoes. Human infrastructure is no match for its power. Most major buildings within a kilometre of the fireball are just ground up down to their base. Only steel reinforced concrete is able to\\npartially resist the pressure. In the surrounding parks where retirees feed the ducks, trees blackened and smoldering from the heat a second before snap like toothpicks. If you're outside, you get tossed away \\nlike a grain of dust in a tornado. The shockwave weakens as it travels outwards but still, about 175 square kilometres of houses collapse like they're made of cards, trapping tens of thousands of people \\nwho didn't have any time to react. Gas stations explode and fire spread\\nthroughout the rubble. A mushroom cloud made from the remains of the fireball, dust and ash rises kilometres into the sky in the next few minutes and casts a dark shadow over the ruined city. This violently pulls in fresh air surrounding the city, destroying more buildings and providing\\nan abundance of oxygen. It depends on the city what happens next. If there's enough fuel, fires may turn into a firestorm that burns the rubble, everybody trapped in it and people trying to flee the devastation. Up to 21 kilometres from the explosion, people just like you rush to their windows to take pictures of the mushroom cloud, unaware that the shockwave is still coming at them, about to shatter their windows and create\\na blizzard of sharp glass. The third phase begins in the coming hours and days. We're used to the idea that help will come,\\nno matter the disaster. This time is different: a nuclear explosion is like every natural disaster at once. There are hundreds of thousands or millions of people with serious injuries: lacerations, broken bones, serious burns. In the next few minutes and hours, thousands more will die because of these injuries. Countless people are trapped in collapsed buildings like in earthquakes or blinded by the flash, deaf from the blast wave and unable to flee through streets impassable with rubble and debris. They're terrified, confused, and don't know what's happened to them or why. Most likely, many hospitals have been leveled along with all the other buildings and most medical professionals are either dead or injured, along with everyone else. The survivors lucky enough to have been in metro tunnels or standing in the right place to be unburned and unhurt won't have truly escaped harm yet. Depending on the type of weapon, where it explodes and even the weather, an awful black rain can begin, with radioactive ash and dust descending on the city, covering everything and everyone. The invisible, malicious, silent horror of\\nradiation takes its turn. Every breath carries poison to the lungs of the survivors. Over the coming days, the people who receive the highest doses of radiation exposure will die. There will be no help, not for hours or maybe even days. Civilisation doesn't operate when \\nthere is a total breakdown of infrastructure. Roads are blocked, train tracks warped, runways cluttered with rubble. No water, no electricity, no communication, no stores to replenish supplies from. Help from surrounding cities will have a hard time entering the disaster zone and even if they can, the radioactive contamination will make it risky to get too close. After a nuclear attack, you're on your own. So, bit by bit, people emerge from the rubble on foot, contaminated with radioactive fallout, carrying what little they may have left. They are slow, in pain, traumatized, and they all need food, water and medical treatment fast. And the damage done by a nuclear weapon doesn't end when the fires burn out and the smoke clears. The hospitals in the neighboring cities are under-equipped for a disaster of this scale and overwhelmed with tens or hundreds of thousands of patients with serious injuries. In the weeks, months and years to come, many of those who survived will succumb to cancers like leukemia. The reason no government wants you to think about all this is because there is no serious humanitarian response possible to a nuclear explosion. There's no way to really help the immediate victims of a nuclear attack. This is not a hurricane, wildfire or earthquake or nuclear accident. It is all of these things at once, but worse. No nation on earth is prepared to deal with it. The world has changed in the past few years, with world leaders again explicitly and publicly threatening each other with nuclear weapons. Many experts think the danger of a nuclear strike is higher than it has been in decades. Governments tell their citizens that it's good that we have nuclear weapons, but it's bad when anyone else gets them. That it's somehow necessary to threaten others with mass destruction to keep us safe. But does this make you feel safe? It only takes a small group of people with power to go crazy or rogue, a small misstep or a simple misunderstanding to unleash a catastrophe of unimaginable proportions. Exploding stuff in videos is fun. Exploding things in real life, not so much. There is a solution though! Eliminating all nuclear weapons \\nand vowing never to build them again. In 2017, almost 2/3 of all the world's countries, supported by hundreds of civil society organizations and the International Red Cross and Red Crescent movement agreed to prohibit and eliminate nuclear weapons. It's not about who has nuclear weapons and who doesn't. The weapons themselves are the problem. They are deeply immoral and an existential threat to all of us. No matter what country you come from, no matter what political side you find yourself on, we need to demand that they disappear forever. This will not happen without pressure. If you want to be part of this pressure, there are things you personally can do too: Visit notonukes.org to learn more about nuclear weapons and what you can do about them. *Kurzgesagt Outro Music*\\n \\n[In space, nobody can hear you- *QUACK*] *Kurzgesagt Outro Music* S\", 'In nearly every corner of the earth, ants wage war against each other. Their weapons are what nature gave them. Some have strong armor, deathly stingers, or sharp mandibles. And then there\\'s this\\ntiny and not very impressive ant, but it rules the biggest empire any ant has ever built. A colony spanning continents and fighting wars that leave millions of casualties. Let\\'s take a look at this unlikely warrioress, \"Linepithema humile\"  \\nthe Argentine ant. ♫ Kurzgesagt intro music ♫ This story begins in the floodplains \\naround the Paraná River, in South America, It\\'s a crowded ant megalopolis where dozens of ant species fight for dominance, including fire ants, army ants and the rather unimpressive Argentine ant. It measures only 2 to 3 millimeters in length and with its small mandibles, it\\'s surprising that it survived among its buff competitors. Their homes are equally unremarkable. Their colonies range from fairly small to very large \\nand could be found anywhere: Under logs, in loose leaf litter\\nor the former colonies of other ants. Here, Argentine ants prepare their most\\neffective weapon against their competitors: bodies. Most ant species have\\nonly one queen to produce ants, while Argentine ants went all-in on numbers. For every 120 workers there\\'s one queen, laying up to 60 eggs a day. So their colonies grow fast and have millions or billions of individuals. Teams of queens and workers frequently branch out and found new colonies. But this strategy has a downside: \\nAs colonies grow and produce a lot of offspring, mutations occur and new colonies adapt to new environments. Their DNA slowly changes from generation to generation and differences accumulate. So after a while the ants that left the colony will become more like distant cousins and start to compete with their mother colony. In their native South American range, this is how Argentine ants behave. Within their colonies they are very cooperative\\nand well-organized, but they fight vicious wars against other Argentine ant colonies and other ant species With equally strong opponents on every side, the Argentine ant became extremely\\naggressive, fighting for every inch of ground. But it could never dominate its neighbours...\\n until humans showed up. We did what humans do and transported things around the world by ship. On one of them, a few Argentine ant queens hitched a ride as stowaways from South America to Madeira and New Orleans. The Argentine ants suddenly found themselves in a strange world. Instead of being surrounded by deadly enemies, they found only victims \\u2060— \\nnobody could fight them effectively. Because only a few Argentine ant queens\\nwere introduced to the outside world, the resulting colonies had very low genetic diversity. On top of that, the introduced Argentine ants kill up to 90% of their queens every year. Fewer queens, less genetic variation. So, as these colonies spread across the landscape, ants that left the colony were no longer\\nconsidered distant cousins. As a result, the new colonies form not opposing but cooperating parties called  \"supercolonies\". This is a very uncommon\\nstrategy in the ant kingdom, only a few of the 16,000 ant species have evolved supercolonies. A supercolony was established on the\\nWest coast of the USA and became a base for the tiny ants\\' global conquest. Today, the Argentine ant inhabits the Mediterranean zones of six continents and many islands. This one supercolony was especially successful, establishing sister locations in California, Europe, Japan, New Zealand and Australia, forming one massive intercontinental megacolony of Argentine ants. This makes them  the largest society on Earth,\\nmore numerous than even the human one. But their success has changed the ecosystems they invaded. California is a perfect example of this. In their greed for more territory, the invading Argentine ants have overrun and replaced 90% of the native ant species, including several species of Californian carpenter ants. Although carpenter ant workers are giants, their colonies have only between 3,000 and 6,000 individuals and stand no chance against an expanding supercolony of billions of Argentine ants. Argentine ant workers attack by wiping toxic chemicals on their victims which irritates the enemy and marks them as a target for other Argentine ants. When they attack, the Argentine ants wash over their victims, clinging on to their opponents in groups \\nand pulling apart their limbs. It doesn\\'t matter how many of them die \\u2060— \\nthere are always more. Once the colony is overrun and exterminated, the Argentine ants feed on their victims brood and take over their home and territory. The Argentine ants\\' numbers allow them to hunt down and devour such an excessive mass of different insects that over time some species disappear\\nfrom the ants\\' territory completely. Argentine ants don\\'t care about working\\nwith the local flora and fauna, they consume them and move on. And, if their next stop happens to be human property, they will rudely make themselves at home there too. They forage in dumpsters, bowls of pet food and sneak into kitchens to claim leftovers. Not just our homes: our gardens and\\nfields are also impacted by Argentine ants, since they tend to hordes of aphids as their cattle. The aphids feed from plants and produce a sweet honeydew, which they trade with the ants for protection. Since the ants have no major enemy to fear in their new homes, the aphids thrive  and ultimately kill the plants they live on. So, on top of being a major disruption\\nfor the ecosystems they invade, they are also a huge pest for agriculture. But the rule of the Argentine ant is being challenged. Parts of the super colonies have broken off and become their own empires. A merciless civil war has broken out. For example, the Lake Hodges Supercolony has been fighting against the Very Large Colony for years in San Diego County. A massive war is going on over a dynamic front line stretching over kilometers, an estimated 30 million ants die here each\\nyear. On other fronts, an old acquaintance from the Parana River has risen from the shadows Red imported fire ants, which were accidentally introduced from their\\nold home to the coast of Alabama, Not only are the red fire ants fierce fighters\\nand more than able to deal with the Argentine ant, they are also able to form\\nsuper colonies themselves. Now the old wars from their distant home have been\\ntaken to a foreign battleground. In the southeastern US the super colonies\\nclashed fiercely. The Argentine ants found themselves outgunned by the fire ants. The fire ants major workers are more than twice the size of the\\nArgentine ants and wield venom-injecting stingers, even though the Argentine ants\\nfought fiercely, the fire ants were too much for them. After countless lost\\nbattles the red imported fire ant exterminated the Argentine ants super\\ncolony from much of the southeastern US. This is one territory lost but the\\nArgentine ants will fight on. This amazing network of cooperating super\\ncolonies is the biggest success in their history. And they\\'ll not give it up because of a small defeat. They will stand their\\nground against any enemy that might arise. No matter if it\\'s on the Paraná River or on one of the large battlefields across the world. ♫ Background music winds up ♫', \"Sometimes the world feels...hmm, boring. We've visited all the remote islands, conquered the Arctic, and penetrated the deepest jungles. But there is still one place to explore. It's a wet and deadly desert inhabited by mysterious creatures living in total darkness. The deep sea. Let's dive down. [♫ Catchy Intro Jingle ♫] When we look at the sheer scale of the Earth's oceans, it's hard to believe that less than 2% of all biomass on Earth lives here. And of that small percentage, around 90% is located close to the surface in the first 200 meters. This is where we begin our journey. Here, light can still penetrate the water which allows photosynthesis to occur. Phytoplankton, trillions and trillions of single-celled algae and bacteria make up the foundation of the ocean's ecosystem, and they're consumed by bigger plankton, who are consumed by other species. The seafloor at this depth is akin to the Amazon rainforest, and is often covered with coral reefs, algae, and other sea plants that are home to a plethora of sea animals. So far, we've focused most of our attention on this comparatively pleasant environment, where we fish, swim, pollute, and do science. So, let's dive deeper. Moving from familiar coastal waters into deeper, more remote waters, we eventually reach the edge of the continental shelf, where we're confronted with the continental slope, the long descent down to the deep sea. With every additional metre of water, light fades drastically, which means there are basically no more plants, and the seemingly steep continental slope begins to remind us of the surface of the Moon. Looking out we're faced by what seems to be endless open water. Let's leave the slope behind us, and enter what's known as the twilight zone, the portal to the deep sea. As we sink down further, the water pressure rises to deadly levels. The deepest scuba dive ever came in at 332 meters. At that depth, the pressure is like having 200 cars stacked on top of you. Yet we've only completed 3% of our journey. While this region seems pretty grim, many fish and other animals actually spend at least half their lives down here. During the day, it's a good place to rest and recover, hidden from predators in the vast dark waters. At night, they can travel more safely into shallower zones to feed in the food-rich surface waters. In this transition zone between twilight and darkness, light becomes a powerful tool. Over 90% of the species indigenous to this deep environment use bioluminescence chemicals to create light. They do so as camouflage against the very faint sunlight, to send signals to potential mates, or to confuse and scare attackers. Or, they use lights to hunt. Another tool for survival in the dark is teamwork. At around 700 metres, we encounter a colony of siphonophores. They can be up to 50 metres in length, but are only as wide as a broomstick. To attract prey, a colony creates a tragically beautiful bright blue or red light, and deploys a curtain of tentacles filled with toxic needles that kill anything that comes too close. But most species living down here have to rely on an unlikely resource: marine snow. White flaky stuff that constantly sinks from the surface to the bottom of the ocean. It consists of dead plant or animal parts, fecal matter, shells, sand, or dust. Even though this doesn't sound very tasty, without this crucial resource, life in the deep sea would starve. It's in this area that the most fascinating battles between two unlikely enemies could happen. Sperm whales hunt and attack giant squid the size of a house. While the squid fight back ferociously, they probably don't stand a chance, but they do leave permanent marks on their killer's skin. As we reach 1,000 meters, deeper than the tallest structure built by humans, we need to be careful. This is the midnight zone, a place of utter darkness. A barely explored wet wasteland consisting of nothing but endless black open water. At these depths, it's harder for a human to take a swim than to take a walk in space. Finding food down here is really hard, so life had to adapt, and become extremely energy efficient. Like the 30-centimetre-long vampire squid that floats through the water without motion, with long and slender catching arms extended. They're covered in tiny stiff hairs, which brush food from the water. This saves a lot of energy compared to actively catching food. For carnivorous fish, it's much harder to find food since living prey is quite rare down here. So the hunters have to get a perfect grip on their victim on first strike, otherwise it will escape into the dark. Many deep-sea predators have several sets of long and deadly teeth. Like the viperfish, which uses its long fangs to trap even large prey and swallow it whole. Or the frilled shark, with its impressive set of 300 teeth, which are curved backwards to hook their victims in their mouths. We sink further, below the 3,800 mark, as deep as the grave of the Titanic. We are now at abyssal depths. Here, life happens in slow motion. Preserving every last bit of energy is crucial for survival. Everything down here hovers motionless, or swims in a slow, elegant fashion. The only time the animals living in this zone move fast is when they have to escape danger. Like the Dumbo octopod paddling with its ear-like fins, or the grenadiers fish with its slow, eel-like tail beats. At 4,000 meters, we finally reach ground again: the abyssal plain. It's covered in grey mud and rocks dusted with the remains of marine snow, which is consumed by animals like sea cucumbers, shrimp, sea urchins, and sea worms. In some regions of the seafloor, small, dark mineral deposits can be seen. These are manganese nodules. Deep-sea corals and sponges use them to anchor themselves on the bottom of the sea. Though life is sparse on the deep sea floor, even down here there are oases. In the rift valleys, where tectonic plates are splitting apart, magma heats up seawater and creates dark jets of water and minerals as hot as 400℃ that form elaborate chimneys and towers. Extremophile bacteria use the minerals to create organic substances that are the bases for unique ecosystems. As we descend further, we reach the deepest point of the abyssal plain at 6,000 meters. For most of the seafloor, this is as deep as it gets, but if we want to get to the deepest point of the oceans, we're actually only halfway there. Let's enter the hadal zone, the underworld of the sea. It consists of long narrow trenches that only make up around 0.25% of the oceans, and are among the most extreme environments on Earth. Only extremophiles exist down here, like the ethereal snailfish, that holds the record for the deepest living fish ever seen, at around 8,000 meters. We see spiky and sharp black rocks rush by as we sink down to more than 10,000. Until we reach the final slope, a trench inside the larger Mariana Trench with gently-sloping sides that enframe a valley about 1.6 kilometers wide. This is it. The deepest point, the Challenger Deep. 11,000 meters below the surface. The water pressure here is 1,086 bar. Taking a swim here is like having to balance 1,800 elephants on top of you. But even here, life has found a way to thrive. Next to sea cucumbers, white and light pink amphipods wiggle their way through the water. Their size is astounding. While their shallow-water cousins are merely a few centimetres long, the deep-sea version can reach up to 30 centimeters. And there are other things floating elegantly through the water. Plastic bags that were found by scientists in 2018. Even the remotest place on Earth is not safe from human influence. There's nothing left to do now and our oxygen is running out, so we begin our ascent. [♪ Deep Sea Ambience ♪] After hours of traveling through dark nothingness, we finally see a glimpse of light. We arrive back at a calm surface. The oceans are so deep. There is so much of them. We owe it to ourselves and to our descendants to preserve them as well as we can. There are still so many wondrous things left to be discovered.\", \"you were on your way home when you died it was a car accident nothing particularly remarkable but fatal nonetheless it was a painless death the Medics tried their best to save you but to no avail your body was so utterly shattered you were better off trust me and that's when you met me what happened where am I you died I said matter of factly no point in mincing words there was there was a truck and it was skidding yes I I died yes but don't feel bad about it everyone dies you looked around there was nothingness just you and me what is this place is this the afterlife more or less are you God yes I'm God my kids my wife what about them will they be all right that's what I like to see I said you just died and your main concern is for your family that's good stuff right there you looked at me with Fascination to you I didn't look like God I just looked like some man or possibly a woman some vague authority figure maybe don't worry I said they'll be fine your kids will remember you as perfect in every way they didn't have time to grow contemptuous of you your wife will cry on the outside but will be secretly relieved to be fair your marriage was falling apart if it's any consolation she'll feel very guilty for feeling relieved oh so what happens now do I go to heaven or hell or something neither you'll be reincarnated ah so the Hindus were right all religions are right in their own way walk with me you followed along as we stro through the void where are we going nowhere in particular it's just nice to walk while we talk so what's the point then when I get reborn I'll just be a blank slate right a baby so all my experiences and everything everything I did in this life won't matter not so you have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives you just don't remember them right now I stopped walking and took you by the shoulders your soul is more magnificent beautiful and gigantic than you can possibly imagine a human mind can only contain a tiny fraction of what you are it's like sticking your finger in a glass of water to see if it's hot or cold you put a tiny Part of Yourself into the vessel and when you bring it back out you've gained all the experiences it had you've been in a human for the last 48 years so you haven't stretched out yet and felt the rest of your immense Consciousness if we hung out here for long enough you'd start remembering everything but there's no point to doing that between each life how many times have I been reincarnated then oh lots lots and lots and into lots of different lives this time around you'll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 ad wait what you're sending me back in time well I guess technically time as you know it only exists in your Universe things are different Where I Come From Where where you come from oh sure I come from somewhere somewhere else and there are others like me I know you'll want to know what it's like there but honestly you wouldn't understand oh you said a little let down but wait if I get reincarnated to other places in time I could have interacted with myself at some point sure happens all the time and with both lives only aware of their own lifespan you don't even know it's happening so what's the point of it all I looked you in the eye the meaning of life the reason I made this whole universe is for you to mature you mean mankind you want to ask to mature no just you I made this whole universe for you with each new life you grow and mature and become a larger and greater intellect just me what about everyone else there is no one else in this universe there's just you and me you stared blankly at me but all the people on Earth all you different incarnations of you wait I'm everyone now you're guting it I'm every human being who ever lived or who will ever live yes I'm Abraham Lincoln and you're John wils Booth too I'm a Hitler you said a called and you're the millions he killed I'm Jesus and you're everyone who followed him you fell silent every time you victimized someone you were victimizing yourself every act of kindness you've done you've done to yourself every happy and sad moment ever EXP experienced by any human was or will be experienced by you you thought for a long time why why do all this because someday you will become like me because that's what you are you're one of my kind you're my child wow you said incredulous you mean I'm a God no not yet you're a fetus you're still growing once you've lived every human life throughout all time you will have grown enough to be born so the whole universe it's just an egg I answered now it's time for you to move on to your next life and I sent you on your way [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]\", \"Some groups just don't get along. Every day, billions of soldiers fight a merciless war on thousands of fronts, and it's been going on for over 100 million years. The World War of the Ants. [Music] Ants are ancient beings that arose around 160 million years ago and took over a wide variety of ecological niches so successfully that they became one of the dominant animals on planet Earth. Today, they count more than 16,000 different species with over 10,000 trillion individuals. Collectively, ants alone make up 20% of the entire animal biomass on land. Similar to humans, their recipe for success is collaboration. While a single ant is pretty useless, together, they are able to achieve stunning feats. They construct complex colonies, care for livestock, pursue agriculture, or have complex symbiotic relationships. And of course, ants wage war. Even among the same species, a constant state of conflict is pretty common. Skirmishes, raids, and full-on invasions are happening every day, causing millions of casualties. Let's look at some of the most interesting ones in a series of videos. In this one, the army ant, a swarm made for war. The army ant group consists of about 200 different species. Army ants do not build nests; they live a sort of nomadic lifestyle with groups of millions of individuals. On a hunt, some species form large columns up to 100 metres long, killing and immediately dismembering every insect or small vertebrate they encounter. The biggest hunting parties can kill up to 500,000 animals per day. Some army ants specialize in hunting and consuming other social insects, like termites, wasps, and especially other ants. Wasps are fierce and may seem invulnerable, but if a swarm makes its way to their colonies, they don't even stand a chance. The much bigger and stronger wasps might kill a few of them, but they are quickly overwhelmed. Even if their queen survives an attack, the army ants steal the colony's larvae and quickly devour them. There is no recovery from that. When army ants discover another ant colony, they immediately attack. Now you might think this would be a more even battle, but it's not. Because army ants act as a social unit, they are especially dangerous and effective. Most army ants are not particularly impressive individually, but they can overwhelm their victims with sheer numbers before the victim colony can mount an effective defense. And so invasions tend to be won by the attackers, and the prey colony is damaged significantly or is exterminated. Interestingly, army ants don't fight army ants. When two swarms encounter each other in the wild, they either pass through each other, ignoring the other swarm, or both colonies just move away, which makes sense from an evolutionary standpoint. Army ants that fought other army ants probably eradicated themselves millions of years ago. Indeed they're so deadly that other ant species had to specialize to survive their presence. Many species just panic and evacuate their nest when they notice army ant scouts, carrying as many larvae with them as they can, in order to return and rebuild after the attack. Other species have invented living bunkers since fighting is so futile. They have worker classes that have big square heads. When army ants show up, they use them to block the entrances to their nests, so the attackers have to give up after a while. But not everybody is afraid of army ants. Leafcutter ants form some of the largest and most complex societies of any animal other than humans. They live in extensive nests, many meters deep and across, harboring millions of citizens with a highly sophisticated division of labor. Like huge soldiers, 100 times more massive than a worker. Their sole purpose might be to defend their colonies against army ants. They still have a nemesis though. The diet of the army ant species Nomamyrmex esenbeckii consists mostly of the larvae of other ants. Compared to other army ants, they have a more robust soldier caste. So far, they are the only known species that can successfully attack a mature colony of leafcutters. When they find a leafcutter colony, hundreds of thousands attack in a long column. The moment the leafcutter ants notice the army ant attack, they go into crisis mode and immediately alert their soldiers, who very quickly swarm to the site of attack. A frontline develops that can be a few meters wide and up to a meter deep. The leafcutter soldiers go head-to-head with the army ants, locking on them and trying to cut through their heads. Smaller leaf cutter workers help by grabbing the enemies. Small teams carry out attacks behind the frontline, where they dismember their enemies by ripping their legs from their bodies. The attackers meanwhile try to swarm their victim's soldiers, and sting them to death in a mob. Despite the powerful defense and the determined response, the army ants are still superior in numbers. So without knowing if the battle can be won, the leafcutters prepare for the worst. Workers rush to create barricades and seal off as many entrances to their nest as possible to secure their route. If the leafcutters are not able to repel the invaders, or at least barricade enough of their entrances in time, the army ants swarm the nest, overrunning all opposition. They penetrate deep into the hidden chambers and steal tens of thousands of the leafcutters' brood to eat them. Even if the leaf cutter colony survives, this is a heavy blow. Regardless who's won the war, thousands lay slain on the battlefield. When the army ants attack, death follows them. But there are other species that form much more dangerous ant armies. Species that form supercolonies covering thousands of square kilometers over multiple continents engaging in wars kilometers across. They deserve their own video though. No matter the scale, war is a part of ant existence. Be it between huge colonies, or small groups trying to fend off a raid. In tropical rainforests, but also in the cracks of the concrete we walk over every day. Humans have decided that war is not a thing that they want to do a lot anymore. For ants though, the other ant will always be the enemy. No, some groups just don't get along.\", \"\\u200b\\u200b Every living being needs to fight off other\\nliving beings that want to feast on them.\\u200b Every living being needs to fight off

time.\\u200b For example, the pleasant warmth you feel at the beach\\u200b is your skin heating up from exposure to\\u200b electromagnetic infrared radiation from the sun.\\u200b We are surrounded by natural, and generally harmless,\\u200b sources of electromagnetic radiation all the time\\u200b and always have been.\\u200b But, since the Industrial Revolution,\\u200b we have added a lot of it to our immediate environment.\\u200b The question of whether this is actually dangerous\\u200b first got public attention when a 1979 study\\u200b linked leukemia to living near power lines.\\u200b This particular study was quickly discredited though.\\u200b The connection could not be explained\\u200b and no direct causal link was confirmed.\\u200b But once this had been proposed, the idea persisted.\\u200b And the thousands of studies about possible dangers\\u200b illustrate that it\\'s still seen as a very real threat.\\u200b A lot of people claim to be sensitive to the radiation\\u200b coming from our appliances and cell phones.\\u200b They report symptoms like headaches,\\u200b nausea, skin reactions,\\u200b burning eyes, or exhaustion.\\u200b But those are just effects reported on a day-to-day basis.\\u200b A few studies have found much more unsettling results.\\u200b Like, possible connections between the side of the brain,\\u200b which people use when they are on their phones,\\u200b and the appearance of brain tumors.\\u200b The question that science is trying to answer,\\u200b is not so much about the acute effects of irradiation.\\u200b We know, for example,\\u200b that x-rays cause immediate damage to the DNA in your cells\\u200b but that the same doesn\\'t happen with radio waves.\\u200b The question is rather:\\u200b Is the sort of weak electromagnetic radiation\\nwe are constantly surrounded by\\u200b harmful in the long run as a result\\nof some as-yet-unknown mechanism?\\u200b Answering this question was much harder than we first thought.\\u200b There are thousands of primary sources,\\u200b reports, and statements by an onslaught of different organizations.\\u200b So, we read a lot for this video.\\u200b You can take a look at our research in the video description.\\u200b What we found is that this debate is a good example\\u200b of how science should be communicated\\nand how it shouldn\\'t.\\u200b Many of the much-cited studies that spread panic\\nabout electromagnetic radiation\\u200b are highly controversial.\\u200b For example,\\u200b a series of population studies based on surveys and self-reporting.\\u200b What this means is, for example,\\u200b asking brain tumor patients how much they think\\nthey used their phone in the last few years.\\u200b The problem is that people are unreliable.\\u200b We tend to misremember things or can be influenced easily.\\u200b On top of this,\\u200b studies or media reports may be cherry picking\\nthe findings that best suit their opinion\\u200b or make for the most exciting headline.\\u200b For example,\\u200b a study looking for cancer in rats and mice from cell phone radiation.\\u200b The results seemed to show a connection.\\u200b But, for some reason, only in male rats.\\u200b And, none at all in mice.\\u200b But it was \\u200b\\u200breported\\u200b as if this study did prove\\u200b that mobile phone radiation causes cancer.\\u200b Unfortunately, this is the case for studies\\nwith both positive and negative findings on the issue.\\u200b Another aspect, is that the WHO did\\nofficially classify radio frequency fields\\u200b as possibly carcinogenic.\\u200b But what this actually means\\u200b is that there are some hints that they might cause cancer,\\u200b but we can\\'t prove it, and that we will keep an eye out.\\u200b So, if we zoom out a bit, what\\'s the big picture?\\u200b On the whole,\\u200b there was no consistent evidence in human studies\\u200b that electromagnetic radiation below\\nexposure value limits causes health problems.\\u200b There are some statistical associations\\u200b but they\\'re mostly weak and inconsistent.\\u200b If there were any definite cause-effect relations\\u200b we would know by now because of all the data we have.\\u200b So, based on the current state of science,\\u200b should you worry about the radiation\\nfrom your laptop, or cell phone, or TV?\\u200b The answer is no.\\u200b You shouldn\\'t.\\u200b But what about the people who say it \\u200b\\u200bis\\u200b harming them?\\u200b Research show they could be experiencing\\u200b\\n\\u200bwhat\\'s known as the \\u200b\\u200bNocebo Effect\\u200b.\\u200b If you have a headache and happen to start\\nfeeling better right when you switch off your laptop,\\u200b you might see a connection between those two things.\\u200b Once you get this suspicion, the idea alone\\nthat weak radiation might harm you\\u200b could be the very thing harming you.\\u200b It\\'s easy to belittle these people;\\u200b most of them feel they\\'re not being taken seriously,\\u200b which makes the situation even worse for them.\\u200b They should get support.\\u200b But, it\\'s important to be aware that, so far,\\u200b we have no robust evidence that electricity below\\nsafety limits has any negative effect on humans.\\u200b In the attention economy we live in,\\u200b talking about unproven dangers can make us\\nneglect things that we know for sure are bad for us.\\u200b Just one example:\\u200b Outdoor air pollution is linked to\\n4.2 million premature deaths each year,\\u200b and is definitely something\\nwe could have a real impact on today.\\u200b Still, to make people feel safe, and just to make sure,\\u200b there are several long-term studies ongoing already.\\u200b For example, the Cosmos study that will look\\nat the possible health impacts of cell phone use\\u200b by exactly measuring frequency and duration of phone calls.\\u200b But while we wait for the conclusion of these long-term studies,\\u200b there are a lot more pressing problems to focus on.\\u200b', \"When our vegetarian ancestors started\\neating meat around two million years ago, it wasn't just because animals taste great, it was pure necessity. Climate change made many of the plants our ancestors\\nrelied on less available and meat bridged that gap. From the discovery of fire at the latest,\\nmeat became a staple of the human diet. But over the last few years eating meat has\\nincreasingly been associated with health risks like: heart disease, certain cancers, and an early death. So how unhealthy is meat, really? In this video we'll only talk about meat. Dairy products deserve a video of their own. Biologically, we need to eat for three reasons: for energy, to acquire materials to fabricate our cells, and to get special molecules\\nthat our bodies can't make themselves. The energy and most of the materials come from the\\nthree macronutrients: fats, carbohydrates and proteins. Proteins are the most important resource for\\nrepairing and replenishing our cell structures. The special molecules are a large variety of vitamins\\nand minerals we need to drive metabolic processes. Meat provides us with most of these things. It contains all essential amino acids\\nour body needs and a lot of minerals like: iron, zinc and essential vitamins, some of which are\\nbarely found in plants like Vitamin B12. Only one essential nutrient is missing\\nin most of the meat we consume: vitamin C. It appears in almost all plants\\nand supports our immune system as well as the development of connective tissues. After a few months without it you'd get scurvy. But meat has another big advantage,\\nit's high bioavailability. Some of the nutrients in meat are broken down\\nfaster and available quicker than those from plants. Spinach for example, contains more iron than meat,\\nbut it's absorbed much slower and the body needs more energy to digest it. Several health benefits have also been\\nobserved in communities that rely solely on meat. The Inuit for example, are able to survive in extreme\\nclimate conditions thanks to a purely meat-based diet. Since they consume the whole animal including\\nthe organs, they get every single nutrient they need including vitamin C. So meat itself is definitely not dangerous for us. But its health effects vary, depending on\\nhow its prepared and what animal it comes from. When talking about meat in the Western world, we generally mean muscle tissues\\nthat have a high nutrient density, but also lack some of the vitamins that \\nmake it possible to survive on meat alone. The most healthy animals to eat are probably fish. Fish contains polyunsaturated fatty acids like omega-3, which may lower the risk of cardiovascular diseases\\nand support anti-inflammatory immune functions. As part of a balanced diet,\\nfish can be eaten regularly without worries. Eating fish comes with its own bag of complications though, like overfishing and the destruction of the oceans. We'll talk about that in another video. A close second is the most popular meat, chicken. It's regarded as the meat with the fewest health risks. The only negative health effect\\nof poultry is a bit controversial: fat. It's high content of saturated fats is associated with a\\nhigher cholesterol level and cardiovascular disease. But this idea has also been criticized\\nby a large number of scientists arguing high cholesterol levels might be\\ninherited and not caused by nutrition. So in general, if you want meat and are\\nconcerned about your health, go for chicken. Things start to get problematic with high intakes of\\nred meats like beef, veal, pork, lamb, horse and goat. A recently published study recommends for\\nexample a maximum of 23 grams of red meat per day which is a very small steak per week. However, large-scale meta-analysis studies have shown that eating 100 grams of red meat every day increases the risk of diabetes by 19%,\\nof strokes by 11% and of colorectal cancer by 17%. This sounds alarming. But before we panic,\\nlet's have a look at how these studies were conducted. Because this brings us to the second big problem\\nwhen trying to answer the question of whether meat is unhealthy or not. Most studies that linked health risks to\\neating red meat were case-control studies. Which means taking a group of people with a disease\\nand classifying them by their eating habits. The more red meat they consume, the more likely\\nthey were to contract certain diseases. The problem is that it's very hard\\nto eliminate other factors. People who eat less meat tend to\\nlive a healthier lifestyle in general. They tend to eat more vegetables and fruit\\nand are less likely to smoke and drink alcohol. Most studies try to eliminate these factors,\\nbut it's extremely hard to make definitive statements. Things get worse when\\nwe look at processed meat though. Processing meat means adding certain chemicals by curing, smoking, sorting or fermenting or in other words making it delicious. Bacon, ham, salami, sausages and hot dogs\\ncontain chemicals that are harmful for us like nitrates and nitrites that can damage the DNA\\nin our digestive system and lead to cancer. The w-h-o reviewed 800 studies over 20 years, and concluded that processed wheat is strongly\\nlinked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer. Each extra 50 grams of processed meat per day\\nincreases your risk of cancer by 18 percent. When it comes to cancer risk, processed meat is now in the same category as plutonium, asbestos and smoking. The w-h-o highlights that it's research is\\nonly about the question of whether or not something causes cancer and not to what extent. But processed meat may also significantly\\nincrease the chance of suffering from diabetes, strokes and coronary heart diseases. It also makes a difference what sort of life\\nour meat lived when it was still part of a living being. It's common to feed large\\namounts of antibiotics to livestock in order to prevent diseases\\nwhich can spread antibiotic resistance. Combined, a high consumption of\\nboth red and processed meat could increase your chance of\\npremature death by up to 29%. This means if your chance of dying\\nis at 3% this year, it's now 4%. This might not sound like a lot but tiny percentages\\nhave a huge impact on societies of millions. They also seem harmless until they affect you. To blame meat alone for\\nbad health would be wrong though. There is no evidence that the very essence of meat\\nhas any negative effect beyond it's high fat content. And even this point is highly contentious. Just like with many other pleasures in life,\\nsometimes too much of a good thing is harmful. Most public health agencies suggest cutting\\nmeat consumption to 500 grams a week while studies suggest cutting down\\nprocessed meat as much as possible. So if you feast on meat no more than once\\nor twice a week, you should be good. For most people this already means\\na drastic change in their diets though, The average American consumes around\\nalmost 1600 grams of meat a week. The average German 1100 grams a week. And many of us needs much much more. If you're not really sure, make a small note\\nwhenever you eat meat for a week or two. You'll be surprised how much it really is. So most people watching this video\\nwould benefit from cutting down on meat. Aside from health concerns, there's still the fact that the meat industry is\\none of the largest contributors to climate change and has reached a scale where it's\\nimpossible to deliver millions of tons of meat and still treat animals with dignity. We've already discussed that in detail in another video. All in all, in moderation, meat is not unhealthy\\nand you don't need to become vegetarian overnight to have a real impact on your health and the planet. But your lifestyle choices do matter. For yourself and for others.\", \"Vaccines are celebrated\\nfor their part in fighting disease. But, a growing group of people seem to believe that they endanger\\nour health, instead of protecting it. The Internet is full of stories\\nabout allergic reactions, the onset of disabilities, and even death following\\nvaccination appointments. And, it's true vaccines can have side effects. Let's look at how they work,\\nand how dangerous they really are. Your immune system is a\\ncomplex army of billions of cells. Soldiers, intelligence cells, and weapons factories. Every day, you're attacked countless times, but your immune soldiers alone\\nusually deal with that, so you don't even notice. If an infection becomes serious though, our intelligence cells gather\\nintel about the attackers and activate our weapons factories. You know the weapon: antibodies. They're like targeted missiles produced\\nspecifically to combat the invader. Unfortunately, this process takes\\nseveral days to complete. That gives intruders\\na lot of time to do damage. Contrary to popular wisdom, what doesn't kill you doesn't make you stronger. Our bodies really don't want\\nto fight serious wars over and over, so our immune system came up\\nwith an ingenious way to get stronger and stronger over time. If we fight an enemy that is dangerous\\nenough to trigger our heavy weapons, our immune system automatically\\ncreates memory cells. Memory cells remain in our body\\nfor years, in a deep sleep. They do nothing but remember. When an enemy attacks for a second time, the slumbering memory cells awaken, and order coordinated attacks\\nand the production of antibodies. This is so fast and effective, that many infections you beat once\\nwill never make you sick again. You might even be immune\\nagainst them forever. Which is also why little kids are constantly ill; they don't have enough memory cells yet. And this beautiful natural mechanism\\nis what we build on when we use vaccines. How Vaccines Work As great as memory cells are, obtaining them through an infection\\nis unpleasant and sometimes dangerous. Vaccines are a way of tricking\\nour bodies into making memory cells, and becoming immune to a disease. They pretend to be a dangerous infection. One way of doing this is to inject\\ninvaders that can't do harm. For example, by killing them,\\nor by ripping them into pieces. Our immune systems deal with\\nthese kinds of vaccines pretty easily. Sometimes, it's necessary to make\\nour immune system work harder though, to produce even more memory cells. Live vaccines are the real deal. An enemy that can punch back is\\na bigger challenge than a dead one. But this also sounds like\\na sort-of horrible idea. What if the germs win? To avoid that, we breed a sort-of\\nweak cousin of the real germ in the lab. Just powerful enough to annoy the immune\\nsystem, and create enough memory cells. Okay, so these are the basic\\nprinciples of vaccine use. They provoke a natural reaction in our bodies that makes us become immune\\nagainst very dangerous diseases. Some, like the flu virus, mutate so often that we need a new vaccine every year, but most vaccines protect us\\nfor years, or even a lifetime. But, there's a catch. Like everything in life,\\nvaccines have another side: Side effects. What are they, and what happens\\nif your child develops one? The Risks of Vaccines It's complicated to directly compare the side\\neffects of vaccines with the effects of diseases. For example, hundreds of millions of people are\\nvaccinated against measles in the West, but there were only 83,000\\ncases in Europe in 2018. So, with numbers that different,\\neven mild side effects can seem scary compared to the bad effects of a disease\\nthat we don't see as much anymore. Before the measles vaccine\\nbecame available in 1963, virtually every single child on Earth\\ncontracted measles at some point. An estimated 135 million cases in the 1950s. Every single year. But are measles really that\\ndangerous in the year 2019? With our advanced healthcare\\nand new technologies, are they worth the risk of vaccine side effects? Let's do a thought experiment\\nbased on real numbers. Imagine a developed country\\nin a parallel world. It has good healthcare but\\npeople stop vaccinating. In this scenario, let's say ten\\nmillion children caught measles. What happens? Nine million eight hundred thousand, or 98%,\\nwill get a high fever and a very unpleasant rash. Up to 800,000 of them, or 8%,\\nwill suffer from dangerous diarrhea. 700,000, or 7%, will suffer from an ear infection,\\nwhich can lead to permanent hearing loss. 600,000 kids, or 6%, will suffer from pneumonia\\n-- the most dangerous effect of measles. It, alone, will kill 12,000 children. Up to 10,000 children, or 0.1%,\\nwill get encephalitis. 2,500 kids, or 0.025%, will contract SSPE, a disease where the measles\\nvirus lingers in their brain and kills them a few years later. Taken together, around 2.5 million children will suffer from\\nsomewhat serious effects from measles. And, about 20,000 children\\nwill be killed by measles. It doesn't stop here though. The kids who beat measles are left with\\na severely damaged immune system that needs a lot of time to regenerate. Time for other diseases to do further damage. Aside from that, what's almost guaranteed is that your kids will have a really\\nbad time for about two weeks. Okay, but what about vaccines? It's only fair to look at these risks, too. So, let's repeat our thought experiment. But, this time, we vaccinate ten\\nmillion children with MMR. What would theoretically happen here? After being vaccinated, of our 10 million kids,\\naround ten percent get a fever. 500,000, or 5%, will get a mild rash. Up to 100, or 0.001%, might have a serious allergic reaction\\nand will have to be treated. Up to ten boys, or 0.0001%, might get inflammation of the genitalia. And up to ten kids in total, or 0.0001%, might get the most serious\\nside effect: encephalitis. So, we vaccinated ten million kids. In total, around one hundred and twenty had\\nside effects that were somewhat serious. Thanks to good medical treatment in developed\\nregions, almost all of them will be fine. What about autism? The connection of autism and vaccines\\nstems from one source that has been disproven countless times. We'll link to further reading\\nand videos in the description. But, in 2019, it's fair to say that\\nvaccines do not cause autism. All right, but what about deaths? It's really hard to say if even a single one of\\nour 10 million vaccinated kids would die. We really did look hard and\\ntalked to a lot of different experts. If we ignore self-reporting, we could only come up with a tiny\\nhandful of documented cases for all the hundreds of millions of children\\nwho received the MMR vaccine since 1971. Measles are many, many thousands of\\ntimes more dangerous for your child than even the absolute worst\\ncase of vaccine side effects. You have to search for lethal vaccine side\\neffects with a huge magnifying glass and, even then, it's very hard\\nto find confirmed cases. While, deaths from measles\\nare real and easy to find. In 2017 alone, 110,000 people\\ndied from measles worldwide. Statistically, today,\\n300 children will die of measles. One since this video started. You can compare vaccines to seatbelts. Are there weird freak accidents where\\nsomeone gets killed by their seatbelt? Well, yes. But, do you personally think it's safer\\nto not put a seatbelt on your kid? Wait a second! What if your kid is actually allergic? What if none of the things we've said\\napplies to your specific situation? In this case, you need to become the\\ngreatest vaccination promoter of all. Because if your children can't be vaccinated,\\nonly the collective can protect them. This is called herd immunity, and it's the only thing that\\ncan protect your unvaccinated child. Herd immunity means that enough\\npeople are immune to a disease, that it can't spread, and dies\\nbefore it reaches its victims. But to accomplish this for measles alone, 95% of the people around you\\nneed to be vaccinated. Conclusion The problem with the debate about vaccines\\nis that it's not fought on a level playing field. While the pro-vaccine side argues\\nwith studies and statistics, the arguments against them are\\nusually a wild mixture of gut feeling, anecdotes, and misinformation. And feelings are often immune to facts. We'll not convince anybody\\nby screaming at them. But we can't hide from the reality\\nof what anti-vaccine conspiracies do. They kill babies too young to be vaccinated. They kill healthy children that are just unlucky. They bring serious diseases back\\nfrom the verge of extinction. And, the biggest side effect\\nof vaccines is fewer dead children. Vaccines are one of\\nthe most powerful tools we have to eradicate the monsters that\\nmost of us have already forgotten. Let's not bring the beasts back! Vaccines are celebrated\\nfor their part in fighting disease. Vaccines are celebrated\\nfor their part in fighting disease.

In their cores, we might find the most dangerous substance in existence: Strange matter. A bizarre thing so extreme, that it bends the rules of the universe and could infect and destroy everything it comes into contact with-- --or it could teach us about how the universe began. Maybe both. [Intro music] To understand how extreme strange matter really is, we first need to get a few basics. What is a neutron star, and how does strange matter break the rules of the universe? To get all of this into one video, we\\'ll grossly oversimplify a few things, but we\\'ll provide you with further reading if you want more details. A neutron star is what remains after a very massive star explodes in a supernova. When this happens, the star\\'s core collapses under its own gravity with such a strong inward force that it squeezes nuclei and particles together violently. Electrons are pushed into protons, so they merge and turn into neutrons. All the \"nothing\" inside of atoms is suddenly completely filled with particles that really don\\'t want to be close to each other, but have no choice. They desperately push back against gravity, against the collapse. If gravity wins, they will become a black hole. If they win, they become a neutron star. This makes neutron stars like giant atomic nuclei the size of a city, but holding the mass of our Sun. And here, things get weird. The environment in the core of neutron stars is so extreme that the rules of nuclear physics change. And this could lead to a strange and extremely dangerous substance. But let\\'s not get ahead of ourselves. We first need to know the rules before we learn how they can be broken. Protons and neutrons, the particles making up the nuclei of atoms, are made up of smaller particles called quarks. Quarks really don\\'t want to be alone. They are what we call confined. You can try to separate them, but the harder you pull, the harder they try to pull themselves back together. If you use a lot of energy, they just use this energy to create new quarks. Quarks only exist together as the building blocks of other particles and have never been observed by themselves. They come in many types, but only two appear to make stable matter: the \\'up\\' and \\'down\\' quarks found in protons and neutrons. All other quarks seem to decay away quickly, but this may be different inside neutron stars. The forces operating in their cores are so extreme that they are actually similar to the universe shortly after the Big Bang. Neutron star cores are like fossils, which can let us peer back in time to the beginning of everything. So learning how quarks behave inside a neutron star is a way of understanding the very nature of the universe itself. One hypothesis is that, inside a neutron star core, protons and neutrons deconfine. All the particles crammed shoulder-to-shoulder dissolve and melt into a sort of bath of quarks. Uncountable numbers of particles become one giant thing made purely from quarks: Quark matter. A star made from this is called a Quark Star. Though from the outside, it may not look any different than a regular neutron star. Now, we can finally talk about the most dangerous substance. If the pressure inside a quark star is great enough, it may get stranger, literally. In the cores of neutron stars, some of the quarks may be converted into \\'strange\\' quarks. Strange quarks have bizarre nuclear properties, and they are heavier, and for the lack of a better word, stronger. If they turn up, they could create strange matter. Strange matter might be the ideal state of matter, perfectly dense, perfectly stable, indestructible, more stable than any other matter in the universe. So stable that it can exist outside neutron stars. If this is the case, we have a problem. It might be infectious. Every piece of matter it touches might be so impressed by its stability that it would immediately turn into strange matter, too. Protons and neutrons would dissolve and become part of the quark bath, which frees energy and creates more strange matter. The only way to get rid of it would be to throw it into a black hole. But then again, who cares? All of it is inside neutron stars, except when neutron stars collide with other neutron stars or black holes. They spew out tremendous amounts of their insides, some of which could include little droplets of strange matter called strangelets. Strangelets are as dense as the core of a neutron star. They could be really small, maybe even subatomic, but even the largest strangelets wouldn\\'t be any bigger than a rocket. These strangelets would drift through the galaxy for millions or billions of years until they meet a star or planet by chance. If one were to strike earth, it would immediately start converting it into strange matter. The more it converts, the more it would grow. Ultimately, all of the atoms making up earth would be converted. Earth would become a hot clump of strange matter, the size of an asteroid. If a strangelet strikes the sun, it would collapse into a strange star, eating through it like fire through a dry forest. This would not change the Sun\\'s mass much, but it would become way less bright. So Earth would freeze to death. And like a tiny virus, we\\'d have no way to see a strangelet coming. Worse still, some theories suggest strangelets are more than common, outnumbering all stars in the galaxy. The strangelets could\\'ve formed very early after the Big Bang, when it was as hot and dense as a neutron star core everywhere. They might be clumping around the gravity of galaxies as the universe expanded and evolved. Strangelets could even be so numerous and massive, that they might actually be the dark matter we suspect holds galaxies together. But then again, maybe not. This is speculation. And the Earth and Sun and planets haven\\'t been consumed in a wildfire of strangelets in the past few billion years. So the odds seem good that it won\\'t happen any time soon. Understanding these strange objects today may be the key to understanding the birth of our universe, and why it grew to look the way it does now. When scientists first started playing with magnets and wires and thinking about electrons, they had no idea how technology would evolve in the next hundred years. The scientists thinking about the cause of neutron stars and strange matter today may be setting up humans for a future beyond our wildest imaginations ...or maybe not. Time will tell...', 'Many of our viewers have asked us\\na very serious question: What if we made a big pile of bombs and exploded every nuclear weapon\\nin the world all at once? Strangely enough, we couldn\\'t find a good source to answer this question to our satisfaction. So, we gathered together a few scientists\\nto calculate what would happen. And find an answer to this extremely\\nimportant scientific problem, once and for all. Currently, there are 15,000 nuclear weapons on Earth. The US and Russia both have around 7,000, while France, China, the UK,\\nPakistan, India, Israel, and North Korea own around 1,000 between them. But, how much destructive power is this really? Let\\'s try to put these numbers into perspective. On Earth, there are about 4,500 cities or urban areas with at least 100,000 inhabitants. Some are bigger than others,\\nso we\\'ll assume that on average, we need three nuclear bombs to completely wipe out one city. This means we could destroy\\nevery single city on planet Earth, with our nuclear arsenal, killing more than three billion people\\n-- roughly half of humanity in an instant. And, we\\'d still have 1,500 nuclear weapons left. Now that\\'s what an expert would call, \"overkill.\" So, we can say with confidence,\\nthat we have a lot of nuclear weapons and they can do a lot of damage. But, what if we make a huge pile\\nof all 15,000 bombs and pull the trigger? Let\\'s drop our nuclear pile in the middle of the Amazon rainforest; just a show nature who\\'s boss. Our warheads, piled haphazardly,\\nfit into a small warehouse. A typical US warhead has the power\\nof two hundred thousand tons of TNT. So, fifteen thousand warheads would be\\nthe equivalent of three billion tons of TNT. For scale, this is enough\\nto rebuild the whole island of Manhattan with every building and skyscraper using stacks of TNT. The closest thing we can compare\\nto the energy gathered here, is a volcano. One of the deadliest volcanic eruptions\\nin recorded history took place in 1883, on the island of Krakatoa. The eruption was so powerful, that 70% of the island, and the surrounding archipelago, was destroyed killing tens of thousands of people. Its effects were felt around\\nthe world for days after the event. Our nuclear pile contains 15 times\\nthe energy of the Krakatoa volcanic eruption. So, let\\'s finally push the button. Three, two, one. In a second, a fireball 50 kilometers across\\nvaporizes everything in its way, and creates a blast wave that flattens\\n3,000 square kilometers of forest. Every living thing within\\n250 kilometers will start to burn. The explosion will be heard literally around the world, as the pressure wave circles the Earth\\ntens of times over the next few weeks. Millions of tons of incinerated material\\nare catapulted into the atmosphere. The mushroom cloud reaches\\nthe outer reaches of the stratosphere, pushing up against space itself. After things have calmed down, a small crater -- about ten kilometers across is left in the center of the worst\\nworld fires the planet has seen in millennia, spreading throughout South America,\\nburning down forests and cities alike. And, now, the unpleasant part begins. Extremely radioactive material\\nwill kill living things very quickly, and a large area several kilometers\\naround the crater is now uninhabitable, as is everywhere for hundreds of kilometers downwind. Much of the fallout is carried high\\ninto the atmosphere by the mushroom cloud and carried around the planet. The amount of radioactive material\\nin the environment doubles worldwide, which still isn\\'t civilization-ending,\\nbut we may see more cancer for a while. A portion of the particles will flow\\nto the edge of space for years and cause a nuclear winter that could lower global temperatures\\nby a few degrees for a few years. This explosion was pretty bad if\\nyou\\'re in South America, and especially Brazil. The Amazon rainforest is pretty much history, which is not great. But, human life will go on. OK, but what if we explode more nuclear weapons? Let\\'s suppose humanity decided\\nto mine every bit of uranium on Earth and build as many nuclear bombs as possible. At current usage, it\\'s estimated that there are around\\n35 million tons of uranium in Earth\\'s crust; enough to power human civilization for over 2,000 years, or to build millions of nuclear warheads. For the sake of argument, let\\'s say we create a pile\\nwith the yield of 10 billion Hiroshima bombs, which makes up a cube three kilometers high\\nthat contains roughly the energy of the asteroid impact that ended\\nthe age of the dinosaurs 65 million years ago. Except, it\\'s also nuclear. Three, two, one. Our pile explodes in a fireball\\nstretching so high into the sky that it\\'s visible from half of South America, with so much power that\\nthe ground just splashes like water forming a crater 100 kilometers across. Bedrock on the scale of whole mountain ranges\\nis vaporized in an instant, while thousands of tons of material\\nis catapulted away with such speed, that it\\'s ejected into space. Some leaves Earth forever, while most of it comes raining down\\nas hot, burning debris that heats up the atmosphere\\nto oven-like temperatures, killing most big animals\\nand causing fire storms all over the world. The Earth\\'s crust rings like a bell struck by global earthquakes\\nstronger than anything in recorded history, decimating cities around the world, while hurricane-force winds flatten\\nevery single tree in South America, and wildfires consume the continent. The abundance of hydrocarbons\\nin the Amazon burn to form ash, are cast into the atmosphere, darting the sky and keeping sunlight from reaching the surface, dropping temperatures to near freezing worldwide. The ensuing global winter may last for decades, and results in the extinction\\nof every large animal species, humans included. We could also mention that every corner\\nof the planet is covered with radioactive fallout, but at this point, it doesn\\'t matter that much anymore. This is humanity\\'s extinction event. The astronauts aboard the International Space Station\\nget to enjoy a great view for a while, but it\\'s not unlikely that the spray\\nof rocks blast into orbit will destroy the Station. Those lucky enough to be in bunkers,\\nor in submarines deep below the ocean surface, may survive the longest\\nbefore they exhaust their food supplies, and have to venture out for more. They\\'ll find the world a\\ncharred, freezing, radioactive wasteland. The planet, itself, doesn\\'t care at all. After just a few million years,\\nthe wounds of the explosions have healed and life is thriving, arguably even more so\\nthan when humans were around. If intelligent life emerges again,\\nit might be able to work out what happened. When they study geology,\\nthey\\'ll find a bizarre and very thin layer of rock covering the entire world,\\nenriched in radioactive elements like uranium, and the other nasty things it decays to, mixed with rare earth metals\\nand plastics that humans used. They would probably be very, very confused.', \"Consciousness is perhaps the biggest riddle in nature. Stripped to its core meaning, consciousness is what allows us to be aware\\nboth of our surroundings and of our own inner state. But thinking about consciousness has\\nthis habit of taking us round in circles. We all intuitively know what consciousness is. It's this... It's what you're experiencing here, right now. But once we try to pinpoint just what exactly it is,\\nit leaves us grasping at thin air. And not just us, philosophers and scientists\\nstruggle to define consciousness. Different schools and ideas compete with one another,\\nbut no one has come close to figuring it out. It's unsettling to realise that we don't understand\\nwhat makes us aware of ourselves and the world. In this fuzzy area, consciousness and intelligence\\nare also related, although they are not the same. We'll talk in greater depth about theories of consciousness and intelligence in other videos. Like much of what makes us human, our consciousness is likely to have\\nevolved from less complex forms, as a product of evolution by natural selection. It has probably emerged from an immense several\\n100 million years sequence of countless micro steps, that together make up a sort of\\ngradient of consciousness. What was the first step on this\\npath from the non-conscious to the basic consciousness that ultimately led to the convoluted consciousness we humans enjoy today? [Intro] Take a stone. The consensus is that a stone is not conscious.\\nThough, not everyone agrees even on this. Some panpsychists claim that\\na lump of rock may have an inner life. However, there are no real grounds for any such\\nassumption since stones never show behaviour. Their inner life can neither be proven nor disproven. A more common starting point is with the living things. A living thing, or a self, is a part of the universe\\nthat sustains itself and makes more of its kind. To do so, it needs energy. And this is where an awareness\\nof the world comes in handy. The original function of consciousness was probably\\nto direct a mobile self that was short of energy to a fresh supply of food. On the smaller scales of life,\\nyou don't need to be aware to find food. Trichopax adhaerens - one of the simplest\\nof all animals moves around haphazardly. It slows down in the presence of food,\\nand speeds up in its absence. This is highly effective, and makes the tiny creature\\nspend more time where there is food spend more time where there is food\\nthan where there is not. But it never moves in a particular \\ndirection towards a particular target, and there's no need for it to be\\nconscious of its environment. The first major step towards consciousness was probably taken when mobile selves\\nstarted to move themselves directionally. Moving towards what was good for them, \\nsay food, and away from what was less good, say someone else who thought that they were food. Take Dugesia tigrina - a tiny worm\\nknown for its funny face. Sometimes the worm is hungry, and sometimes not. This means that when it moves, the worm self is not simply producing an\\nautomatic response to an external stimulus, but that its actions depend\\nupon its inner, physiological state, whether it's hungry or sated. When it's just eaten,\\nthe worm is less energetic, but when starved for a while,\\nit will move itself in the direction of tasty things. It uses chemoreceptors on its head\\nto smell its environment, and guide it in the direction\\nwhere the scent of food is strongest. After finding and eating a meal, our worm buddy heads\\nback to a dark sheltered spot to digest it in safety, until it's hungry again. But animals that blindly follow their sense of smell\\ndon't have a concrete objective in view. They still lack any sense of where they are heading. So, the next step on the ladder of consciousness\\nis to add some perception at a distance, like vision. Vision adds context and depth to our world. With vision comes a sense of\\nthe space we and our food exists in. It adds a whole new dimension to awareness, and is\\na huge step towards more familiar consciousness. An optical apparatus, like an eye, enables\\nus to visualise our goal and lock onto it. But even at this stage, a self is only able\\nto pursue its food as long as it sees it. So, the next logical step needs\\nto happen on the inside. To visualise food in its absence, for example, a self needs to create some sort of\\ninner representation of the world. Now, an animal can continue looking for food,\\neven when it escapes its sensory range. Because of this inner representation\\nof what is relevant in the world, it can remain focused on its food and its desire to get it. Our self now exists in a world it can get familiar with. The ability to remember things has emerged. Thanks to memory, animals can be\\ndistracted from the pursuit for a few seconds, but quickly continue their path afterwards. A related phenomenon is called 'object permanence'. This describes our awareness that things\\ncontinue to exist even when we can't see them. This cognitive skill is enjoyed by some mammals\\nand birds, and perhaps other animals too. Human babies tend to develop this ability\\naround the time they turn eight months, while baby chickens show this ability\\nwithin a day or two of being born. The capacity to remember a thing in its absence\\nsuggests at least a basic sense of time. A sense of time is a big step\\non the ladder of consciousness. It may also enable a self to look forward\\nfrom the present moment and anticipate the future. Adult chickens, for example, are able to resist a meal put\\nin front of them if they expect to receive a bigger meal as a prize for holding back for a while. This sort of delayed gratification means there is an\\nability to visualize a reward that only exists in the future, which can be quite a challenge even for adult humans. Western scrub jays are experts in delayed gratification. They show an even more elaborate sense\\nof the future when they hide food in a cache to retrieve it at a later date. The scrub jays will even rehide their food if they become aware that a potential thief has been watching them. This means that they know\\nthat there are other hungry selves out there, who are aware and see the world\\nfrom their own, different perspective. Crafty scrub jays can sort of\\nread the mind of their fellow birds. This ability to mind-read is crucial\\nfor complex levels of consciousness. By putting yourself in the position of others,\\nyou can outsmart a rich competitor, or empathise with a hungry friend. Language takes the ability to read minds\\nand represent what is absent to a whole new level. Words enable us to construct\\nhypotheses about the world, make detailed plans, and to\\ncommunicate them with others. Words enable us to think about ourselves\\nand our place in the universe, and even about our own consciousness, which is something we'll be doing more in future videos. So, what is the origin of our consciousness? It probably began as the directed motion\\nof a hungry self towards a source of food. With the survival benefits, this gave it over \\ncompetitors that moved at random or not at all. It probably all started with the urge for more food. So, even with the sophisticated consciousness\\nthat allows us to dream about space, build skyscrapers, or obsess about novels, it's not surprising that we can't stop thinking\\nabout where we'll get our next meal. Collectively, we've put so much thought\\nand ingenuity into getting food, that we can now just get our food to\\ncome to us with little conscious effort. This video is part one of a three-part video series\\nrelating to big questions of life and the universe, made possible by a grant from the\\nTempleton World Charity Foundation. You can find our sources and \\nfurther reading in the video description, or get the consciousness book\\nby Rupert Glasgow for free- link down below. If you want to help us make more videos,\\nyou can do so on patreon.com, or get one of our posters from our shop.\", \"Can you trust Kurzgesagt videos? To answer this question,\\nwe'll first explain how we research them and then talk a bit about past videos, and what we want to achieve with the channel. Making a Kurzgesagt video\\nalways begins with a question or an issue. For example, after our meat video, many viewers asked about the health effects of meat on humans. We had no idea, and were pretty curious too, so we just decided to work on it. The first step is research. We start by looking for books\\nand scientific papers to get an overview, and just read a lot. The plan is to find a story worth telling. Is there something surprising to learn? Is there a larger context or a new perspective, or will it be an overview or introduction? Once we have the first readable version, we reach out to experts or scientists, and ask them to fact check and correct us. Often enough, they find a flaw or point us in the direction of contradictory research. At this point, many scripts die. If our idea does hold up, we continue working on it. This process can take weeks or months. Our Loneliness script, for example,\\ntook over a year and a half to finish. The hardest part is being brief,\\nwhile not simplifying too much. It's much easier to\\nwrite a long script than a short one. When we're finally done, we do another round of research\\nand show the script to experts again, ideally different ones than the ones we talked to at the beginning of the process. When we express an opinion, we mark it as such. That's not saying that we don't\\ndraw conclusions from the research. Homeopathy does not work,\\nand meat is really bad for the planet. Climate change is real, but organic food\\nis not a good way of solving it. If the facts clearly support a conclusion,\\nit's OK to present it as such. Of course, we can't always make everybody happy. People who know a lot about a topic sometimes get annoyed if we don't mention an aspect they think is crucial, or when we omit technical terms. This is, more or less, unsolvable\\nbecause of the nature of our videos. Scripts have around 1,300 words, so there's always some degree of simplification. You will always find a list of our research and sources and further reading material in the video description. Just citing sources doesn't make your work\\naccurate or your research good though, so we encourage you to use our sources document as a starting point to look at the topic yourself and learn more. But, it would be dishonest to say \\nthat we've always worked this way. Some older videos don't live up\\nto the standards we set ourselves today. The two that annoy us the most\\nare the Refugee and Addiction videos. In both of them, we didn't try to present a balanced perspective, but instead chose a take and ran with it. The Refugee video was made with a deep feeling\\nof angry frustration about the world at the high point of the 2015 refugee crisis. While we argued over quotas,\\ndead children washed ashore on our coastlines. The script was written on one Sunday afternoon, and illustrated and animated within a week. It was exhausting, stressful, and frustrating. We still believe it was the right thing\\nfor European countries to help, but it was absolutely unnecessary\\nto be toxic about it. We insulted people, and brushed away their concerns\\nabout real and profound challenges. The video was divisive and emotional, at a time when the debate needed a calm and clear overview. The addiction video was based on only one source that has amassed a lot of criticism over the years. And, unfortunately, we did not reach out to scientists, or do extra research, on the papers\\nthat were the basis for the video's thesis. That, addiction is purely psychological and based\\non the life circumstances of the individual. This stance is still held by a number of addiction professionals, and we're not saying it's wrong, but a lot of others disagree, and it's not correct to present it as -the- truth. Addiction is far from solved\\nand our videos should have reflected that, instead of taking one side. We simplified an idea so much, that it made a great story, but became distorting. Both videos were made over the span of two months, and they're two of our most successful videos to date. We had found a formula that really worked. But we never made anything like them again, and have been discussing how to deal\\nwith them for a long time. It doesn't help that both videos are loved by many people. We want to be proud of our work, and these two videos don't make us proud. So, today, we deleted them. It won't purge them from the Internet, but that's not the goal anyway. Feel free to upload them elsewhere. We're working on a new addiction video that we'll take a look\\nat the chemical and psychological causes. We'll take our sweet time with it,\\nso please have patience. The refugee video is not up-to-date anymore,\\nso we will not renew it. We're also going through our older videos to add sources, further reading, and comments in the next few months. Nowadays, rather than trusting in mainstream institutions, we often look at creators on the Internet\\nfor reliable information. We rely on the fact that they're careful and rigorous, and not led by monetary incentives. And we expect them to acknowledge mistakes\\nin public, and work to minimize them. So, this is what we're going to do: Trust is not a thing you earn once and then keep forever. You have to constantly work for it. So can you trust Kurzgesagt? You can trust that every video we make\\nis thoroughly researched and approved by different experts. You can trust that we know that we have biases,\\nand we try to overcome them. We want to move Kurzgesagt further\\ntowards the trustworthy end of the spectrum. The world is too complex for simple answers,\\nand we don't want to be the ones giving them. Making these videos over the last six years\\nhas been quite a ride, and we're very grateful for it. We hope you'll be with us for the next few years, too. And join us on our journey to figure out\\nwhat this universe and life stuff is all about. Thank you for watching.\", 'Everybody feels lonely from time to time When we have no one to sit next to at lunch When we move to a new city or when nobody has time for us at the weekend. But over the last few decad es, this occasional feeling has become chronic for millions. In the UK, 60% of 18 to 34 year old say they often feel lonely. In the US, 46% of the entire population feel lonely regularly. We are living in the most connected time in human history, and yet, an unprecedented number of us feel isolated. Being lonely and being alone are not the same thing. You can be filled by bliss by yourself, and hate every second surrounded by friends. Loneliness is a purely subjective, individual experience. If you feel lonely, you are lonely. A common stereotype is that loneliness only happens to people who don\\'t know how to talk to people, or how to behave around others. But population-based studies have shown that social skills make practically no difference for adults when it comes to social connections. Loneliness can affect everybody. Money, fame, power, beauty, social skills, a great personality— nothing can protect you against loneliness, because it\\'s part of your biology. Loneliness is a bodily function, like hunger. Hunger make you pay attention to your physical needs; loneliness makes you pay attention to your social needs. Your body cares about your social needs, because millions of years ago, it was a great indicator of how likely you were to survive. Natural selection rewarded our ancestors for collaboration, and for forming connections with each other. Our brains grew and became more and more fine-tuned to recognize what others thought and felt, and to form and sustain social bonds. Being social became part of our biology You were born into groups of 50 to 150 people, which you usually stayed with for the rest of your life. Getting enough calories, staying safe and warm, or caring for offspring was practically impossible alone. Being together meant survival, being alone meant death. So it was crucial that you got along with others. For you ancestors, the most dangerous threat to survival was not being eaten by a lion, but not getting the social vibe of your group and being excluded. To avoid that, your body came up with \"social pain\". Pain of this kind is is an evolutionary adaptation to rejection. A sort of early warning system to make sure you stop behaviour that would isolate you. Your ancestors who experienced rejection as more painful were more likely to change their behaviour when they got rejected, and thus stayed in the tribe, while those who did not got kicked out and most likely died. That\\'s why rejections hurt, and even more so, why loneliness is so painful. These mechanisms for keeping us connected worked great for most of our history, until humans began building a new world for themselves The loneliness epidemic we see today really only started in the late Renaissance. Western culture began to focus on the individual. Intellectuals moved away from the collectivism of the Middle Ages, while the young Protestant theology stressed individual responsibility. This trend accelerated during the Industrial Revolution. People left their villages and fields to enter factories. Communities that had existed for hundreds of years began to dissolve, while cities grew. As our world rapidly became modern, this trend sped up more and more. Today, we move vast distances for new jobs, love, and education, and leave our social net behind. We meet fewer people in person, and we meet them less often than in the past. In the US, the mean number of close friends dropped from 3 in 1985 to 2 in 2011. Most people stumble into chronic loneliness by accident. You reach adulthood and become busy with work, university, romance, kids, and Netflix. There\\'s just not enough time. The most convenient and easy thing to sacrifice is time with friends. Until you wake up one day and you realise that you feel isolated, that you yearn for close relationships. But it\\'s hard to find close relationships as adults, and so, loneliness can become chronic. While humans feel pretty great about things like iPhones and spaceships, our bodies and minds are fundamentally the same they were 50,000 years ago We are still biologically fine-tuned to being with each other. large scale studies have shown that the stress that comes from chronic loneliness is among the most unhealthy things we can experience as humans it makes you age quicker it makes cancer deadlier Alzheimer\\'s advance faster your immune systems weaker loneliness is twice as deadly as obesity and as deadly as smoking a pack of ciggarettes a day the most dangerous thing about it is that once it becomes chronic it can become self sustaining physical and social pain use common mechanisms in your brain both feel like a threat and so social pain leads to immediate and defensive behaviour when it\\'s inflicted on you when loneliness becomes chronic your brain goes into self preservation mode it starts to see danger and hostility everywhere but that\\'s not all some studies found that when you\\'re lonely your brain is much more receptive and alert to social signals while at the same time it gets worse at gets worse at interpreting them correctly you pay more attention to others but you understand them less the part of you brain that recognises faces get out of tune and becomes more likely to categorise neutral faces as hostile which makes it distrustful of others loneliness make you assume the worst about others intentions towards you because of this perceived hostile world you can become more self-centred to protect yourself which can make you appear more cold unfriendly and socially awkward than you really are if loneliness has become a strong presence in your life the first thing you can do is to try to recognise vicious cycle you may be trapped in it usually goes something like this an initial feeling of isolation leads to feelings of tension and sadness which makes you focus you attention selectively on negative interactions with others this makes your thoughts about yourself and others more negative which then changes your behaviour you begin to avoid social interaction which leads to more feelings of isolation this cycle becomes more severe and harder to escape each time loneliness make you sit far away from others in class not answer the phone when friends call decline invitations until the invitations stop each and every one of us has a story about ourselves and if your story becomes that people exclude you others pick up on that and so the outside world can become the way you feel about it this is often a slow creeping process that takes years and can end in depression and a mental state that can prevent connections even if you yearn for them the first thing you can do to escape it is to accept that loneliness is a totally normal feeling and nothing to be ashamed of literally everybody feels lonely at some point in their life its a universal human experience you can\\'t eliminate or ignore a feeling until it goes away magically but you can accept that you feel it and get rid of its cause you can self examine what you focus your attention on and check if you are selectively focusing on negative things was this interaction with a colleague rarely negative or was it really mutual or even positive what was the actual content of an interaction? what did the other person say? did they say something bad or did you add extra meaning to their words maybe another person was not really reacting negatively but just short on time then there are your thoughts about the world are you assuming the worst about others intentions do you enter a social situation and have already decided how it will go? do you assume others don\\'t want you around? are you trying to avoid being hurt and not risking opening up and if so can you try to give others the benefit of the doubt can you just assume that they\\'re not against you can you risk being open and vulnerable again? and lastly your behaviour are you avoiding opportunities to be around others are you looking of oppertunites to decline invitations or are you pushing away others preemptively to protect yourself are you acting as if you are getting attacked are you really looking for new connections or have you become complacent with your situation of course every person in each situation is unique and different and just in introspection alone might not be enough LEGAL DISCLAIMER if you feel unable to solve your situation alone by yourself please try to reach out and get professional help its not a sign of weakness but of courage however we look at loneliness as a purely individual problem that needs solving to create happiness or as a public health crisis it is something that deserves more attention humans have build a world that is nothing short of amazing and yet not of the shiny things we have made is able to satisfy or substitute our fundamental and biological need for connection most animals get what they need from their physical sourroundings we get what we need from each other and we need to build our artificial human world based on that (giggling)', \"Over the last few years, organic food has spread like wildfire. Despite higher prices, buying organic is turning from an alternative into a moral and social responsibility. Organic food is supposedly healthier more natural and more ethical. But what do we even mean when we say organic? There's no global consensus, so different regions have different definitions and rules. In general, organic food is farmed without GMO seeds, synthetic fertilizers, or synthetic pesticides. Instead, organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food, like crop rotation, and use organic fertilizers such as compost or manure. While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble, is it actually effective or just another costly trend we can skip without feeling guilty? [Music] Is organic food healthier? One idea associated with organic crops is that their natural cultivation is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier. Indeed, several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants. Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide. Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder, while regular plants have plenty of help from humans. Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits, although scientists are still on the fence about them in general. We have no idea if and how exactly they help us, or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount. What about organic being more nutritious? Well, the evidence is mixed. Some studies found that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C, and omega-3 fatty acids, while others did not find significant differences. Overall, the mixed evidence suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value. So, from the science available so far, it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits. What we do know, is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you, and most of us don't do that enough. Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced. Is organic food more natural? People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins, but to avoid something toxic; artificial pesticides and fertilizers. And indeed several studies show that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce. But here's where things get complicated. Less pesticide does not mean none at all. While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming, they're not forbidden. Most organic pesticides are natural toxins, like vegetable oils, hot ash soap, sulfur or copper sulfates. But there are synthetic substances as well. What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides? Not a lot actually. Organic pesticides are not necessarily safer than conventional ones. Toxic is toxic. No matter if the substance is manufactured, or derived from nature. In fact, in the case of copper sulfate, often used on organic apples, the organic pesticide of choice is actually more harmful to humans. The toxicity of any substance depends on its concentration and your exposure to it -- not if it's natural or not. There are a few recent studies about how our current level of pesticide exposure affects our long-term health. The 2018 study from France associated never eating organic food with a higher risk of certain cancers. The study was criticized a lot though. The participants reported their dietary habits themselves, while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done. Complicating things even more, a Danish study from 2018 found that the danger from pesticides for an adult was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months. The pesticides on your vegetables are nothing to lose sleep over. Despite this, we should continue to demand strict standards for our food. All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly in the EU and the US. Every year, thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides. The majority of samples have no residues or just a fraction of the tolerance level. Right now, contamination from bacteria and fungi is much more dangerous. And, on this front, the risk is the same -- be it organic or regular food. Is organic food better for the environment? In 2017, a meta-analysis looked at organic farming in detail and analyzed organic and regular foods from over 700 production sources, and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, and land needs. The result? No production method is clearly better for the environment. Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones, but have similar greenhouse gas emissions. Organic farms use less pesticide, but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop. These mixed results were also confirmed by a report from the Swedish food agency. Organic and regular were equal in most regards. The biggest difference was land use. And here conventional farming clearly won, and ecotoxicity where organic farming has a clear advantage. So, according to these results, conventional farming actually has a little bit less impact on the environment compared to organic. The bottom line is organic food isn't superior to regular produce as far as we know. But, organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level. Demand is rising constantly, and the struggle to supply the market can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways. Spain, for example, grows tons of regular and organic vegetables destined for export in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy. And have other environmental impacts, such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions. And, because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production, the global trade and organic foods is also increasing. As supply chains get more and more complex, to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality, ensuring organic quality standards and regulations gets ever more difficult. This has led to incidences of fraud where conventional food was labeled and sold as expensive organic produce. But, organic versus conventional food isn't even an objective discussion. Organic is not simply a production method. For many, it's an ideology. Buying organic feels right. People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children, and the well-being of the planet. But, our instinct to think of organic as good, and conventional as bad, can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision. The solution could be to stop seeing organic and conventional farming as irreconcilable. They both have pros and cons, and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently would be a combination of their best features. And, as for your personal shopping, what food you should buy depends on what you expect from it. If you simply want to eat healthily, you should buy more fruit and vegies of any kind, not necessarily organic. If your concern is for the environment, then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you. The easiest option, is to buy local food that's in season. Basically, seasonal is the true organic. To sum up, an organic label is a manufacturing notice, not a security certificate or a silver bullet for your diet. What you eat is much more important than how its produced.\", 'Rogue planets are planets that travel through the universe alone. They inhabit the dark and vast space between the stars. Drifting alone through eternal darkness, no light warms their surfaces, and they\\'re exposed to the freezing cold of outer space. They know no seasons, no days, and no nights,\\nwhich could give away the passing of time. And yet, rogue planets might carry alien life to all corners of the galaxy. How would that work? And how does a planet become a rogue anyway? [Music] There are several very different things that get called rogue planets. For example, sub-brown dwarfs\\n-- gas giants that form from collapsing gas clouds and are the boring little brothers of brown dwarfs. They\\'re a sort of failed star, and we\\'ll now stop talking about them. A far more interesting sort of rogue,\\nare terrestrial planets, similar to Earth, that got kicked out of their planetary system. Young star systems are dangerous places, where protoplanets are battling for the available mass, guzzling up as much material as possible. In this fight for dominance, they collide with each other, or get dangerously close to each other\\'s orbits. If a very massive planet moves its orbit closer to the star, it can kick smaller planets out of the system. But just because a planet has survived the growing pains of formation, doesn\\'t mean it\\'s safe. Planetary systems can be disrupted by flybys from stars, or black holes, at any point. Up to half of all planets born could end up as rogues. Scientists don\\'t agree on the numbers, but it\\'s likely that, at the very least, there are billions of rogue planets in the Milky Way alone. Most rogues will share the same depressing fate, as their star becomes smaller, day by day, the planet\\'s surface quickly cools down to minus 270 degrees Celsius. If they have oceans, they\\'ll freeze and become as hard as bedrock. Their atmospheres will sink down to the surface\\nand eventually freeze, too. But, weirdly enough, some of these frozen, dark deserts could harbor life. To understand how, let\\'s imagine a planet similar to Earth, in the same order of magnitude in terms of mass and composition. If we put it into deep space, how could it still support life? As far as we understand the nature of life, there is one indispensable ingredient it needs: liquid water. Water is important because it mixes things, both matter and energy, which lets interesting chemistry happen, like life. So our planet needs enough energy to keep at least a part of our oceans warm enough to sustain liquid water. Annoyingly, about 99.97% of Earth\\'s energy budget comes from the Sun. So our imaginary rogue earth needs to work with the 0.03 percent of energy it has left, which almost exclusively comes from its hot center. Earth\\'s inner core is a giant metal ball, about as hot as the surface of the Sun, that\\'s surrounded by the outer core made up of liquid metals that are very, very slowly solidifying releasing a lot of heat in the process. As long as this process is ongoing, our planet will be geologically active with solid and liquid material moving around and transporting energy to the surface where it can be harnessed as geothermal energy. While the hot core of every planet will cool off eventually, this process takes billions of years. Enough time for life to come into existence and thrive. There\\'s even one scenario that could allow an Earth-like planet to have oceans that are not frozen over. If the planet had an extremely dense\\nand high-pressure hydrogen atmosphere, the gas would not freeze and could trap enough of the heat trying to escape the planet to enable oceans that extend all the way to the surface. And there\\'s another possible way to stay warm: moons. If a rogue planet brings a moon or more along with them, a large enough moon could inject additional energy into the system via tidal forces. These forces stretch and squeeze the planet a little bit every day, like kneading dough, keeping it warm. But the most likely scenario for a rogue bearing life is one with sub-glacial oceans  under a kilometer thick layer of mostly water ice. These are not completely absurd,\\nsince we already have a few of them in the Solar System. So how could life sustain itself\\nat the bottom of a completely dark, cold ocean. On Earth, deep down in our oceans in complete darkness, in volcanically-active areas, there are hydrothermal vents called black smokers. They spew out a cloud of black material and hot water providing a constant flow of minerals from Earth\\'s mantle. Bacteria feed on the minerals and produce organic materials, which attracts crustaceans, bivalves, snails, fish, octopus, and tube worms up to 2 meters long. Not only are hydrothermal vents home\\nto an incredibly diverse group of living beings, but also a contender for the place\\nwhere life could have begun on Earth billions of years ago. In the dark ocean of a rogue planet,\\nsimilar events or volcanic activity, could be the starting point and basis for complex ecosystems we can only imagine right now. One upside an ecosystem in a rogue planet ocean has, is that the environment is extremely stable. The thick ice sheet protects it\\nfrom all sorts of extinction events, and, as long as the energy from the core keeps on coming, things stay pretty much the same. The most likely forms of life\\nare bacteria and other microorganisms. But, given enough time, more complex alien animals could feed\\non the smaller beings and thrive. It\\'s not impossible that intelligent life\\ncould emerge in such an environment. If it did, it would find itself in a pretty weird world. Constricted by an impassable wall of rock-hard ice at the top, and bedrock at the bottom. Without any plants to store star energy, there would be no wood, oil, or coal. Even if there were,\\nit\\'s not like you\\'d discover fire at the bottom of an ocean. Without this energy, metals may never be forged into useful things. Our intelligent alien friends might never break through the ice. They might never realize that there is such a thing as outside, and assumed that their small world is all there is. Millions of generations might live and die in these dark oceans, ignorant of the unbelievably big universe above the ice. Until the core of their planet cools off, and all life vanishes. As the oceans completely freeze, the remnants of cultures and ecosystems will be trapped in an icy grave forever. If you think about it,\\nit might be better not to be aware of all that. But the concept is disturbing and exciting. The universe might be teeming with life, trapped on planets that are basically impossible to leave. Worlds like this could frequently pass the Solar System,\\nwithout us even knowing. Maybe one day, in the far future, humans will set foot on one of these frozen worlds and try to say \"hello.\"', \"Human history is told by the energy we use. At first we had to use our muscles, then we learned to control fire. We industrialized the world using coal and oil and entered the Atomic Age when we learned how to split a nucleus. At each step, we increased our energy harvest to a scale never seen before and advanced as a species. Currently, we're slowly transitioning to renewables and if we're lucky, fusion energy will become viable in the future. As humanity progresses further, if we don't destroy ourselves or our habitat, we will likely gain complete control of our planet's resources. At that stage we'll probably begin to look outwards for new places to expand into. But space is hard and establishing a serious human presence in the solar system will require ungodly amounts of energy. Luckily, we know where to find it. The Sun - the ultimate source of energy. A furnace 100 quintillion times more powerful than our most efficient nuclear reactor. It shines with the energy of a trillion nuclear bombs per second. So, how do we get this energy? Not some of it, all of it. If we want to collect the most energy physically possible, we'll have to build the largest most ambitious structure in the universe. The Dyson Sphere, a megastructure that encompasses a whole star to capture its power output. For an intelligent species, building a Dyson Sphere is a technological leap on a par with the discovery of fire for our ancestors. The transition from a planetary species to an interstellar species. It would usher in an age of exploration and expansion on a scale we can barely imagine. So, what would it look like? Solid shell enveloping the Sun is probably not the way to go a large rigid body like that would be vulnerable to impacts possibly shattering it would be liable to drift and could crash straight into the Sun a More, viable design for a Dyson Sphere might be a Dyson swarm an enormous set of orbiting panels that collect the sun's power and beam it elsewhere such as sward would give humanity basically unlimited energy but building it won't be easy the Sun is very big so we need a lot of satellites if Each satellite is a square kilometer we'd need around 30 quadrillion to surround the Sun even if they're built as lightly as possible we need about 100 quintillion tons of material and Then we need the energy to actually put the parts together and deliver them to their positions around the Sun on top of all that we need to have a permanent infrastructure set up in space to start building let's assume for the purposes of this video that our descendants will take care of that and want to create the mega structure We can sort the challenges into three main categories materials design and energy To get the vast amounts of raw materials required for our Dyson swarm will have to largely disassemble a whole planet Of the planets available mercury is the best candidate it's the closest to the Sun and very metal-rich close to the Sun also Means less moving stuff around and mercury has no atmosphere and only about a third of the surface gravity of Earth making it comparatively easy to launch material into space Next we should consider the design of our swarm simpler is better Conventional solar panels are far too intricate and short lives our satellites need to operate without repairs or intervention for astronomically long times and they need to be cheap to produce But they're most likely going to be enormous mirrors which refocus sunlight to central collecting stations like in concentrated solar power on earth to build and launch them efficiently they must be incredibly light made of little more than polished metal full bound to some supports and Last we need the energy to build and launch the swarm itself taking a part of planets and launching things into space requires an enormous amount of energy for example if we used all the fossil fuels and Uranium on earth and we? Were perfectly efficient we could only launch as much Mass as Mount Everest into space a rather meager accomplishment compared to planetary disassembly To get the energy needed to build a Dyson Sphere it's almost as if you're going to need the power output of a dyson sphere But that's. Ok there's plenty of sunlight to be had on Mercury so let's get to work Humans are expensive to keep alive and are very sensitive to the environment So, we'd want to automate as much as possible Ideally we'd have a small crew of controllers who oversee an army of autonomous machines doing the actual work There are four major pieces of technology required solar collectors miners refiners and launch equipment the solar collectors are going to give us the energy we need to disassemble the planet To start maybe we deploy something like one square kilometer of them either as mirrors or as traditional solar panels they'll provide the energy to run our miners which strip-mine the surface of the planet and our refiners which extract valuable elements and fabricate them into our swarm satellites to get them into space we need a creative and efficient solution Rockets aren't too expensive and difficult to deorbit and reuse Instead, we'll want to use a sort of railgun a longer Electromagnetic track which launches our satellites at high speeds Our swarm satellites will be packed tight for launch unfurling like an enormous origami once in orbit from this point we can take advantage of exponential growth using the energy of the existing parts of the swarm to build more infrastructure on Mercury and launch new panels faster and faster each panel provides the energy to build another those to work together to build the next to Four become eight eight become 16 and so on within just about 60 doubling times the Sun would be completely surrounded by solar panels and This can happen quickly if a square kilometer of solar collectors takes a month to build we could be done in a decade if only our infrastructure on the planet's surface can keep up with the quickly growing budget of energy Even collecting 1% of the sun's energy is an unbelievable change in our species energy budget We could create the infrastructure to being basically unlimited amounts of energy around the solar system for all sorts of projects colonies on other worlds terraforming planets constructing more mega structures or even traveling to other stars it could be the start of an interstellar Civilization based on physics alone this is not just possible but easy It's such a simple process and such a necessary step for any species to expand beyond their home planet that many astronomers Think there are probably Dyson spheres already out there in the Milky Way we haven't spotted any yet but they could be there it's far from certain that humanity will ever get to this point our attention is too often focused on short-term political gains and Conflicts that will not matter in the long run but if we survive the challenges we've set ourselves we could potentially become the first species in the universe to create a structure with the scope of a star if We? Do it the only limitation left will be our own imagination\", \"Space travel is the most exciting and challenging adventure humanity has ever undertaken. But in an irony \\nof history, we may stop ourselves from going \\ninto space the more we do it. With every \\nrocket launched and with every \\nsatellite deployed, we're creating a trap for ourselves that gets \\ndeadlier and more dangerous every year. If it's ever activated, it could end the Space Age and trap us \\non our planet for decades, or even centuries. Getting something into space \\nis incredibly hard. To do so, you need \\nto move very, very fast. At first, straight up\\nto leave the atmosphere, then sideways to begin \\na sort of circling around the Earth, still, very, very fast. If you do that successfully \\nyou can enter a Low Earth orbit. And once in orbit, it's very hard \\nto get out of orbit. Unless you have \\nenergy to spare, you're sort of locked in here, \\nfalling around the Earth forever. That's great for things \\nwe want to stay up, like space stations \\nand satellites. And so we moved the majority of humanity's \\nspace infrastructure to this place, just a few hundred kilometers \\nabove the surface. Just high enough so that the atmosphere \\nis so thin, that orbiting things \\ncan stay up for centuries before air resistance can slow them \\nenough to bring them back to Earth. But this is also the source \\nof our deadly trap. Rockets are really metal cylinders \\nthat keep big parts of fuel in place. Whenever a portion \\nof the fuel has been spent, the empty tanks are dropped \\nto make the rocket lighter. Some parts \\ncrash down to earth or burn up \\nin the atmosphere. But most of the useless \\nrocket parts stay up and begin \\nto orbit the planet. After decades \\nof space travel low Earth orbit is a junkyard of spent boosters, broken satellites and millions \\nof pieces of shrapnel from missile tests \\nand explosions. Right now we know of around \\n2,600 defunct satellites, 10,000 objects bigger \\nthan a monitor, 20,000 as large \\nas an apple, 500,000 pieces \\nthe size of a marble and at least 100 million parts \\nso small they can't be tracked. This debris is moving \\nat speeds of up to 30,000 km/h, circling Earth on criss-\\ncrossing orbits multiple times a day. Orbital speeds are so fast \\nthat being hit by debris the size of a pea is like \\nbeing shot by a plasma gun. On impact the debris vaporises, releasing enough energy \\nto punch holes straight through solid metal. So, we've covered the space around our planet with millions of deadly pieces of destruction, and we also put a trillion dollar \\nglobal infrastructure network right in the danger zone. It performs critical duties \\nessential to the modern world: global communication, GPS \\nand navigation, collecting weather data, looking out \\nfor asteroids and all manner \\nof scientific discoveries: things we would miss very much \\nif they suddenly went away. If just one pea-sized bullet \\nhits one of our 1,100 working satellites, \\nit will be destroyed instantly. Three or four satellites are already \\nbeing destroyed this way every year. As the number of satellites and the amount of junk in orbit is expected to grow tenfold in the next decade, we're approaching \\na tipping point. But the worst thing in space \\nis not tiny pieces of junk. The worst thing would be \\nan unstoppable chain reaction that turns a lot of non junk things \\ninto junk. For example: if two satellites hit each other \\nin just the right way. If satellites collide they don't stop \\nand fall out of the sky. It's more of a splash \\nthan a crash. Orbital speeds \\nare so fast solid pieces spray \\nright through each other, transforming the two satellites \\ninto clouds of thousands of little things still fast enough \\nto destroy more satellites. This could trigger the slowest \\nand most destructive sort of domino effect: a collision cascade. Like a shotgun spray, each collision \\ncreates more bullets. What was once \\na single tiny target very unlikely to hit anything becomes \\na wall of destruction hungry \\nto make more. As more and more satellites \\nare destroyed the destruction \\naccelerates exponentially, eventually destroying \\neverything parked in orbit. But space \\nis very empty, so the first few collisions \\nmay take a long time. By the time we realize \\nwhat's happening, it's too late. One year one satellite \\nis destroyed and that's \\nno big deal. The next year, five. The year after, 50. Until there's nothing left. The situation in orbit \\nis rapidly worsening and we may already \\nbe past the point of no return. Within 10 years space around Earth may no longer \\nbe viable for long term satellites or rockets. The worst case scenario \\nis horrifying. A debris field made of hundreds \\nof millions of pieces, many too small to track,\\nmoving at 30,000 km/h. It would effectively create \\na deadly barrier around Earth, possibly too dangerous \\nto cross. Dreams \\nof moon bases, Mars colonies \\nor space travel at all may be \\nset back centuries. And the loss \\nof our space infrastructure would send some of the technology \\nwe rely on daily back to the 1970s. But it might not be too late \\nto clean up our mess. While the space industry has become \\nbetter at avoiding space junk, it's still growing fast and occasional \\nweapon tests don't help. So there have been a couple of wild \\nbut also serious suggestions. About how to quickly remove \\nas much deadly space junk as possible without creating more \\nin the process. Lots of ideas \\nare being thrown around, and some \\nof the most seriously considered involve capture \\nand return missions, which are \\nbeing tested now. One method involves meeting a piece of junk\\nin orbit with a small satellite and loaded with a net. Once caught, a small rocket could be used \\nto bring it down towards Earth. Targets too large for a net might be instead caught \\nwith a harpoon on a tether. Instead of firing \\na rocket the cleaner would deploy a large sail \\nto produce atmospheric drag and accelerate\\norbital decay. And there are lots of other wild sci-fi \\nsounding proposals too. Some might use \\ngiant electromagnets. These magnetic tugs work by pushing on \\nthe magnetic components inside satellites that they use \\nto stabilize and orientate themselves \\nin Earth's magnetic field. These may be safer and more reliable \\nthan nets and harpoons because they never have to make contact \\nwith the junk they're handling, so there's no risk of accidentally breaking up \\ntheir target into more junk. As for the tiniest bits of junk, lasers might be the key \\nto vaporising them entirely. Satellites with lasers wouldn't \\nneed to visit their targets. They can shoot them \\nfrom far away. Large objects \\ncan't exactly be shot down, but lasers \\ncan be used to ablate them, or burn tiny amounts \\nof material off the side to push the junk \\nto a safer orbit. Whatever technology we use at the end,\\nwe better start doing something soon, before 100 million bullets become \\na trillion and the trap is set. If we don't act, our adventure \\nin space might end before \\nit's even begun.\", \"A lot of things can be beautiful. Landscapes, faces, fine art, or epic architecture; stars in the sky. Or simply the reflection of the sun on an empty bottle. Beauty is nothing tangible, it only exists in our heads as a pleasant feeling. If we have to define it, we perceive something as beautiful if its color, shape, form, or proportion somehow are appealing or delightful to us. Beauty is a very human experience that's been with us for millions of years. Even our first tools were trimmed to a symmetrical shape. Researchers have tried to find practical reasons why our ancestors invested the time to make their tools look nice, but couldn't really identify any. It seems that early humans shaped their tools into teardrops, simply because they liked them better that way. Throughout our history, the definition of beauty has changed a lot. Ideals have shifted or turned into their opposites. But beyond individual and contemporary tastes some things have never really gone out of fashion. The golden ratio, symmetry, or fractal patterns can be found in the art and architecture of cultures from our beginnings, to today. Humans seem to be in mysterious, inherent agreement about the beauty of certain things. The patterns that keep coming up are all rooted in nature. They became part of our biology because they helped our ancestors survive. Fractal patterns for example, occur all over nature. In snail shells, flower heads; waves or clouds Identifying and assessing these things and phenomena correctly used to be vital. Do those clouds mean rain will come soon? Are these waters safe to swim through? Can I eat this? Another pervasive thing is symmetry. In nature it means everything is as it should be Stems and trees and leaves and blossoms all grow symmetrically A deer with impressive antlers is probably a source of nutritious meat. A deformed wheat hair may not be safe to eat. A symmetrical face is more likely to belong to a healthy and fertile mating partner. Because symmetry is so common in fauna and flora, it's extremely familiar to our brain. It helped our ancestors evaluate their environment more easily, and react quickly to danger. Things that helped us survive activate the reward center in our brain. recognising signals of safety and nutrition, triggered nice feelings in us. So our sense of beauty probably evolved from pattern recognition, but it goes way beyond that now. Humans seem to have evolved an instinct for beauty that is deeply hardwired into us. It remain even after other processes in our brain stop working. Alzheimer's patients were asked to rank the beauty of several paintings Then the experiment was repeated two weeks later The patients have long since forgotten the paintings, but still ranked the beauty of the paintings in the same order. One could argue that this doesn't say much. So what if people stick to their personal preferences? But other research has shown that we have a sort of lowest common denominator when it comes to beauty. In different experiments, people were asked to distinguish real from fake abstract paintings. Some were originals by Mondrian and Pollock that were painted based on strict rules like fractal patterns, while the imitations were not. The majority picked out the original artworks. This worked for paintings from both artists, even though their arts are very different. Another experiment also used abstract artworks but, asked people to pick them out among similar paintings made either by children or animals. Again, the test subjects pointed out the legit paintings whose patterns were carefully planned and not random So while we have a hard time pinning down what beauty is or what it's based on, we somehow recognize it when we see it Humans don't navigate nature trying to survive day by day anymore We left the natural world behind and created our own. We made the objects that surround us the things we wear and use and look at. As we spread over the planet and our numbers grew, we shaped a completely man-made environment. In the process of doing so, we often neglected beauty in favor of functionality cost or efficiency. We built rows and rows of concrete housing blocks that nobody wants to live in. We have ugly underground subway stations, shabby public service buildings, and sprawling malls. One bland, standardized box beside the next. Humans, don't like monotony. Eye tracking software has shown that people keep focusing on details and ornaments of architecture while brushing quickly over blank walls And not only are they no fun to look at, they actually make us miserable. Experiments with skin sensors showed that looking at vast, dull facades makes us feel bored and uncomfortable. This kind of boredom has been linked to raised heart rates and stress levels and the opposite seems to be true, too. Over the last decades more and more studies have found that surroundings that are actually aesthetically pleasing to us can improve our well-being, our behavior, cognitive function, and mood. Our bodies and brains react measurably and visibly to everything that surrounds us Beauty in particular has such a strong impact on our well-being that making useful things beautiful can actually make them better. In 2017, a hospital examined recovery factors through observation and interviews with patients and found that visual art in their lounge areas made them more comfortable and happier about their stay in general. Another study looked at how well patients recovered in a hospital that had two wards. A very old and rather ugly one, and a newly renovated ward. To the researchers' surprise, the patients that stayed in the new, renovated environment, needed less pain medication and were released on average, two days earlier than patients recovering in the old ward. More beautiful surroundings made them feel better, physically. Beauty also has an effect on us on a daily basis. It can improve our general happiness. A study that looked at the main factors influencing the happiness of adults revealed an unexpected result. Besides things like good health in a harmonious family life, individual happiness is affected by how beautiful you find the city you live in. Beauty scored even higher than cleanliness or safety. So what can we learn from all of this? We know that we humans have been fine-tuned for millions of years to process visual input and assess our surroundings. It's just what we're programmed to do and we're starting to learn more about how much beauty as a property is really influencing us. Beauty meets an inherent need for meaningful information. Maybe it would be worth giving it more space in this man-made world we have created. This video was a collaboration with the creative agencies, Sagmeister and Walsh as a contribution to their upcoming beauty exhibition. The exhibition will be shown at the Mak Vienna from Oct. 23, 2018 - Mar. 31, 2019 and a Mak Frankfurt from May 01, 2019 - Sept. 30, 2019 If you want to learn more about the impact of beauty and see tons of gorgeous installations and multimedia objects, go check it out! review: Doğa Poyraz Tahan\", 'Humans love meat. Steak, fried chicken, bacon, pork belly, and sausages\\nare just the best things! Eating meat has become so\\ntrivial that many people don\\'t consider something a proper\\nmeal if there\\'s no animal involved. Which is pretty amazing, since only a few decades ago\\nmeat was a luxury product. Today, you can get a cheeseburger\\nfor a dollar. Paradoxically, meat is pretty much the\\nmost inefficient way of feeding humans. If we look at it on a global scale, our meaty diet\\nis literally eating up the planet. Why is that, and what can we do about it,\\nwithout giving up steak? ♪ Catchy intro tune ♪ Humans keep a lot of animals\\nfor food: Currently about 23 billion chickens, 1.5 billion cattle, and roughly 1 billion pigs and sheep. That\\'s a lot of mouths to feed, so we\\'ve transformed earth into a giant feeding ground. 83% of its farmland is used for livestock. For example as pasture, and to farm fodder crops;\\nlike corn and soy. That\\'s 26% of earth\\'s total land area. If we include the water we need\\nfor these plants, meat and dairy production accounts\\nfor 27% of global freshwater consumption. Unfortunately; meat production is like\\na black hole for resources. Since animals are living things, most of their food\\nis used to keep them alive, while they grow their tasty parts. Only a fraction of the nutrients from fodder crops end up in the meat we buy in the end. Cows, for example,\\nconvert only about 4% of the proteins and 3% of the calories of the plants we feed to them\\ninto beef. More than 97% of the calories are lost to us. To create one kilogram of steak, a cow needs to eat up to 25 kilos of grain and uses up to 15,000 liters of water. Animal products are guzzling up tons of food, but they only make up 18% of the calories humans eat. According to projections, we could nourish \\nan additional 3.5 billion people if we just ate the stuff we feed to animals. To make our favorite food group\\neven more unsustainable, about 15% of all greenhouse gas emissions\\ncaused by humans, are created by the meat industry; as much as by all ships, planes,\\ntrucks and cars combined. And... there\\'s another aspect to meat: It comes from actual living beings. Pigs, cattle and chicken are not the ones\\nwriting the history books, but if they were, humans would appear\\nas rampant genocidal maniacs, that thrive on suffering. Globally, we kill about 200 million animals every day, about 74 billion a year. This means that every one and a half years, we kill more animals than people have lived\\nin the entire 200,000 year history of humanity. One could argue that we\\'re doing them\\na favor: after all,\\nthey wouldn\\'t exist without us. We might eat them in the end, but we also provide food and shelter, and the gift of existence to them. Unfortunately, we\\'re not very nice gods. A lot of our meat comes from factory farms: huge industrial systems\\nthat house thousands of animals. Engineered to be as efficient as possible, they have little regard for things like quality of life. Most pigs are raised in gigantic windowless sheds, and never get to see the sun. Sows are kept in pens too small to turn around, where they give birth to one litter of piglets after another, until it\\'s their turn to be turned into bacon. Dairy cows are forced to breed continually \\nto ensure their milk supply, but are separated from their calves\\nhours after birth. To fatten up beef cattle for slaughter,\\nthey\\'re put in feedlots: Confined pens where they can\\'t roam\\nand put on weight more quickly. To make it possible to keep them so tightly together\\nwithout dying of diseases, the majority of antibiotics we use are for livestock: up to 80% in the US. Which helps in the short term,\\nbut also fuels antibiotic resistances. But the ones that may have got the worst deal\\nare chickens. In factory farms, they\\'re kept in such vast numbers and so close to each other, that they can\\'t form the social structures they have in nature, so they start attacking each other. To stop that we cut their beaks and claws. Male chickens are deemed worthless: since they can\\'t lay eggs and are not suitable\\nfor meat production. So within minutes after birth,\\nthey\\'re usually gassed and shredded in grinders. Several hundred million baby chickens\\nare killed this way each year. Even if you had a personal score to settle with chickens, how we treat them is beyond broken. So, better buy organic meat\\nwhere animals are treated nicely, right? Organic farming regulations are designed to grant animals a minimum of comfort. The problem is that \"organic\" is an elastic term. According to EU regulations, an organic hen still might share\\none square metre of space with five others. That\\'s a long way off from happy farmyard chickens. Farms that sincerely do their best\\ndo exist of course, but meat is still a business. An organic label is a way\\nto charge more money, and countless scandals\\nhave revealed producers looking for ways\\nto cheat the system. And while organic meat might be less cruel, it needs even more resources\\nthan conventional meat production. So, buying organic is still preferable, but does not grant you moral absolution. The truth is,\\nif suffering were a resource: we would create billions of tons\\nof it per year. The way we treat animals will probably be one of the things future generations will look down on in disgust. While all these things are true,\\nsomething else is true too: Steak is amazing; Burgers are the best food; Chicken wings taste great. Meat satisfies something\\nburied deep in our lizard brain. We hardly ever see\\nhow our meat is made: we just eat it and love it. It creates joy, it brings us together for family meals\\nand barbecue parties. Eating meat doesn\\'t make you\\na bad person. Not eating meat doesn\\'t make you\\na good one. Life is complicated\\nand so is the world we\\'ve created. So, how should we deal with the fact\\nthat meat is extremely unsustainable, and a sort of horrible torture? For now, the easiest option is opting out more often. Taking a meat-free day per week\\nalready makes a difference. If you want to eat meat produced\\nwith less suffering: try to buy from trusted producers\\nwith a good track record, even if it costs more. To make an impact on the environment: go for chicken and pig,\\nrather than lamb and beef, as they convert their feed\\nmore efficiently into meat. And if you\\'re going to have your steak:\\nyou should eat it too! An average American throws out\\nnearly a pound of food per day, a lot of which is meat. In the future, science could get us clean meat. Various startups have successfully\\ngrown meat in labs, and are working on doing so\\non a commercial scale. But solutions like this\\nare still a few years away. For now, enjoy your steak, but also respect it. And if you can: make it something special again.', \"Humans dream about leaving Earth\\nand traveling through the galaxy. But we were born too early to be part of it. Or were we? The reality is, we could begin our dream\\nby building a Moon base today. We actually do have the technology and current estimates from NASA\\nand the private sector say it could be done for 20 to 40 billion dollars,\\nspread out over about a decade. The price is comparable to\\nthe International Space Station or the budget surplus of Germany in 2017. Not that big an investment really. The payoff would be immeasurable. The Moon is a sandbox to develop new technologies and exploit unlimited resources. It would start a new space race and lay the foundation for us to spread out\\ninto the solar system and beyond. It would create a vast array of new\\ntechnologies to benefit us on Earth and we would all be part of it. So, why aren't we doing it? Well, sadly, it's hard to get governments interested in long-term investments in the future of humanity. Let's imagine, just doing it. If we start today, how would we build a Moon base? (Kurzgesagt intro music) Kurzgesagt in collaboration with BRILLIANT Throughout history, colonization happened in phases: In the first phase of the age of exploration\\nof the new world, for example, European monarchs funded expeditions to chart\\nand discover and to stake their claims. They planted a flag and set up a camp,\\nbut they didn't stay. In the second phase, small missions set up outposts and settlements were founded, which was still very dependent on\\ntheir home countries for supplies. Some failed, but others survived and\\nestablished a permanent presence. Only then, in the third phase, did a true colony form to which tradesmen and laborers could emigrate, creating new wealth and opportunities\\nfor themselves and their families, sending extreme wealth back\\nto their countries of origin. When we colonize the Moon, we'll go through the same three phases. This time, without murdering millions\\nof innocent people in the process. The Moon is not a welcoming place for living things. A Moon day lasts 29 Earth days, with a difference of maybe 300 degrees\\nCelsius between sunlight and shade. There's no atmosphere to shield us from meteorites,\\nbig and small, or cosmic radiation. Worse still, the lunar surface is covered\\nin a layer of nasty jagged dust. The Moon is hard. But we're good at doing hard things. In the first phase of lunar colonization, our explorers proved it can be done that a new world can be reached. This phase started 60 years ago with the Apollo missions. Since then, satellites like the American Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter have mapped the Moon, while rovers like the Chinese Yutu (玉兔), have studied the composition of the lunar surface, Looking for water, ice, and metals. Phase one is more or less complete. We know what we need to know to enter phase two. In the second phase, astronauts will build the first Moonbase and this could begin today. The first small Moonbase could\\nbe completed in a decade. The first nation that establishes this base, will be akin to the first nations building outposts in the new world 500 years ago. It's expensive to send rockets to the Moon. So we will send as little as possible. The base will be light, little more than inflatable habitats for crews of no more than 12, and will be deployed somewhere with natural shelter. Options include caves, like underground lava tube tunnels, or craters near the poles, where the days are six months long. These astronauts will not stay long. The habitat is likely to be abandoned between missions, as solar panels cannot generate\\nelectricity during the lunar night. But they'll do the groundwork to enable\\nhumans to stay permanently. Our first crew will consist of scientists and engineers who will study the composition of the Moon and whose experiments will explore ways\\nof using the available lunar material. Say, and purifying the lunar ice and turning\\nit into the water for human use. And water is important for far more than drinking. They can use it to experiment with growing plants for food. Hydrogen fuel cells will store power through the long night, extending astronauts' stays. And most importantly: It could be split into hydrogen and oxygen. Rocket fuel! By harvesting water from the Moon and putting it into orbit, the Moon base will supply an orbital depot. Where scientific missions to Mars and the outer solar system can refuel. Compared to the Earth, it's much easier and cheaper to get things off the Moon into orbit. Colonizing Mars may mean starting from the Moon. But this isn't a true colony, not yet. The base will be abandoned if funding stops. If we want our base to grow into the third phase, into a true colony, it must become self-sufficient supporting itself via exports to Earth. Now, private contractors arrive looking to get rich off lunar resources and support services. If it's cheaper to produce rocket fuel in space, what else can they get rich on? They could extract precious metals, abundant in impact craters and other raw materials from the lunar regolith. One promising possibility is the mining of Helium-3, an isotope that could one day be used in nuclear fusion reactors, something the Chinese lunar exploration\\nprogram is currently looking into. Future colonists may export Helium-3 back to Earth, providing us with cheap and clean fusion energy. Asteroids could be pulled into the Moon's orbit and then mined. With commercial exports to Earth, the colony is fully in its third phase, self-sufficient and economically productive. Our base will begin using lunar material in its construction projects if it's to continue growing. Fortunately, lunar soil has all the necessary\\ningredients to make concrete. Robotic mining rigs can sift the lunar dust for organic molecules and could be used to build huge structures way too massive to be brought from Earth. While advances in 3D printing, will make it possible to produce almost\\neverything else the crews need. It's hard to say when exactly the colony\\nbecomes self-sustaining. Growth is gradual, experiments are replaced by industry and the population steadily reaches the hundreds, encompassing more than just scientists. Engineers, pilots, and contractors representing countries and corporations will be present. Two of these people will make a breakthrough. Not scientific, but social. They will have the first extraterrestrial child. Throughout history, the birth of the first child was celebrated\\nas a moment where the seed of a colony finally and irreversibly took root. Here, it means that the Moon is not just a place for scientists and engineers to work, it's a place for people to live, to raise a family. Once this transition happens, the colony grows rapidly, building more habitats and schools and farms and all the things needed to support the growing population. As our colony grows, all kinds of new technologies will be invented to sustain it. They might develop crops that efficiently recycle carbon dioxide, or the grow with very little water. They might find ways to recycle and reuse 100% of their waste, technologies that are extremely valuable for Earth. They could even build the first space elevator in the solar system. With a space elevator, spacecraft, astronauts and raw materials, could be brought back and forth from lunar orbit, without needing to use rockets at all. The Moon may become a hub for economic activity on a scale that's hard to imagine right now. It's hard to say who will own the colony at this point. Will the first person born on the Moon\\ntake the national identity of their parents, or will a new generation meld together\\ninto a new lunar society? And when existing treaties that bar any nation from owning the moon are inevitably rewritten, will the colonists be given a say? Will they declare independence from the Earth? However it happens, the Moon is a perfect sandbox to learn\\nhow to colonize the Solar System, the perfect project unify nations, and the only way to guarantee our survival as a species, should something tragic happen on Earth? If we ever want to colonize the Milky Way, we'll have to start somewhere. So why not start there? Why not start now?\", \"If you saw a wormhole in reality, it would appear round, spherical, a bit like a black hole. Light from the other side passes through and gives you a window to a faraway place. Once crossed, the other side comes fully into view with your old home now receding into that shimmering spherical window. But are wormholes real, or are they just magic disguised as physics and maths? If they are real, how do they work and where can we find them? [Kurzgesagt Intro] For most of human history, we thought space was pretty simple; a big flat stage where the events of the universe unfold. Even if you take down the set of planets and stars, there's still something left. That empty stage is space and it exists, unchanging and eternal. Einstein's theory of relativity changed that. It says that space and time make up that stage together, and they aren't the same everywhere. The things on the stage can affect the stage itself, stretching and warping it. If the old stage was like unmoving hardwood, Einstein's stage is more like a waterbed. This kind of elastic space can be bent and maybe even torn and patched together, which could make wormholes possible. Let's see what that would look like in 2D. Our universe is like a big flat sheet, bent in just the right way, wormholes could connect two very, very distant spots with a short bridge that you could cross almost instantaneously. Enabling you to travel the universe even faster than the speed of light. So, where can we find a wormhole? Presently, only on paper. General relativity says they might be possible, but that doesn't mean they have to exist. General relativity is a mathematical theory. It's a set of equations that have many possible answers, but not all maths describes reality. But they are theoretically possible and there are different kinds. EINSTEIN ROSEN BRIDGES The first kind of wormholes to be theorized were Einstein Rosen Bridges. They describe every black hole as a sort of portal to an infinite parallel universe. Let's try to picture them in 2D again. Empty space time is flat, but curved by objects on it. If we compress that object, space-time gets more curved around it. Eventually, space-time becomes so warped that it has no choice but to collapse into a black hole. A one-way barrier forms: the event horizon, which anything can enter but nothing can escape; trapped forever at the singularity at its core. But maybe there is no singularity here. One possibility is that the other side of the event horizon looks a bit like our universe again but mirrored upside down, where time runs backwards. In our universe things fall into the black hole. In the parallel universe, with backwards time, the mirror black hole is spewing things out a bit like a big bang. This is called a white hole. Unfortunately, Einstein-rosen bridges can't actually be crossed. It takes an infinite amount of time to cross over to the opposite universe and they crimp shut in the middle. If you go into a black hole, you won't become the stuff coming out of the white hole. You'll only become dead. So, to travel the cosmos in the blink of an eye, humans need a different kind of wormhole; a Traversable Wormhole. VERY OLD STRING THEORY WORMHOLES If string theory or one of its variations is the correct description of our universe, then we could be lucky and our universe might even have a tangled web of countless wormholes already. Shortly after the Big Bang, Quantum fluctuations in the universe at the smallest scales far far smaller than an atom may have created many, many traversable wormholes. Threaded through them are strings, called cosmic strings. In the first billionth of a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the ends of these tiny, tiny wormholes were pulled light-years apart; scattering them through the universe. If wormholes were made in the early universe, whether with cosmic strings or some other way, they could be all over; just waiting to be discovered. One might even be closer than we realize. From the outside, black holes and wormholes can look very similar; leading some physicists to suggest the supermassive black holes in the center of galaxies are actually wormholes. It will be very hard to go all the way to the center of the Milky Way to find out though, but that's okay. There might be an equally extremely hard way to get our hands on a wormhole, we could try to make one. MANMADE WORMHOLES To be traversable and useful, there are a few properties we want a wormhole to have. First, it must obviously connect to distant parts of space-time. Like your bedroom and the bathroom, or Earth and Jupiter. Second, it should not contain any event horizons, which would block two-way travel. Third, it should be sufficiently sized so that the gravitational forces don't kill human travelers. The biggest problem we have to solve, is keeping our wormholes open. No matter how we make wormholes, gravity tries to close them. Gravity wants to pinch it closed and cut the bridge; leaving only black holes at the ends. Whether it's a traversable wormhole with both ends in ours, or a wormhole to another universe, it will try to close unless we have something propping it open. For very old string theory wormholes, that's the cosmic strings job. For man-made wormholes, We need a new ingredient. Exotic matter. This isn't anything like we find on earth, or even antimatter. It's something totally new and different and exciting, with crazy properties like nothing that's ever been seen before. Exotic matter is stuff that has a negative mass. Positive mass like people and planets and everything else in the universe, is attractive because of gravity. But negative mass would be repulsive; it would push you away. This makes a kind of anti-gravity the props open our wormholes. And exotic matter must exert enormous pressure to push space-time open, greater even than the pressure of the centers of neutron stars. With exotic matter, we could weave space-time however we see fit. We may even have a candidate for this exotic matter, the vacuum of space itself. Quantum fluctuations in empty space are constantly creating pairs of particles and antiparticles, only for them to be annihilated an instant later. The vacuum of space is boiling with them, and we can already manipulate them to produce an effect similar to the negative mass we're looking for. We could use this to stabilize our wormholes. Once we're keeping it open, the ends would start together. So, we'd have to move them around to interesting places. We could start by wiring the solar system; leaving one end of each wormhole in orbit around the earth. We could flick others into deep space. The earth could be a wormhole hub for a vast interstellar human civilization spread over light-years, but only a wormhole away. However, wormholes have a dark side. Even opening a single wormhole, kind-of breaks the universe in fundamental ways, potentially creating time travel paradoxes, and violating the causal structure of the universe. Many scientists think that this not only means they should be impossible to make, but that it's impossible for them to exist at all. So, for now, we only know that wormholes exist in our hearts, and on paper in the form of equations.\", \"What would happen if we detonated humanity's most powerful nuclear weapon at the deepest point of the ocean? For sure, tsunamis hundreds of meters high would destroy coastal cities, earthquakes would level countries, new volcanoes would bring us nuclear winter. Maybe even Earth could be ripped apart? Or thrown out of orbit? Well, almost. Currently, Earth's deepest known point is inside the Mariana Trench. The Mariana Trench is a very deep valley right at the edge of two tectonic plates that looks like an upside-down mountain. It reaches a depth of about 11 kilometers, almost three times deeper than\\nthe dark grave of the Titanic. It's one of the last places on Earth for humans to explore. Pitch black and under a thousand atmospheres of pressure, it's a relatively pristine environment thanks to the absence of humans. A great place for our nuclear test. We'll use the most powerful nuclear bomb humans have ever exploded, the RDS-220 hydrogen bomb or Tsar Bomba. Its explosion was so massive that its shockwave traveled around the Earth three times, and its mushroom cloud stretched 56 kilometers into the sky. Its shockwave was strong enough to destroy everything in a thousand square kilometers, its fireball hot enough to burn the rubble. Bombs like this release such an enormous amount of energy at once, that they could boil away an entire lake. And if we set off a nuclear bomb in the Mariana Trench, that's exactly what happens. Let's pull the trigger. In the first few microseconds, the nuclear fuel undergoes its chain reaction and explodes with the power of 50 megatons of TNT. A blinding flash of light illuminates the darkness of the trench for the first time in history. The heat of the explosion produces a cavity, a flaming bubble of water vapor, radioactive nuclei, and the remains of very unlucky fish. The bubble grows quickly as it vaporizes the water around it. The pressure of the bubble is immense, plowing outwards as if there's nothing in the way. Sending off a shockwave that will be felt by seismic stations and whales around the world. And then, almost as fast as it emerges, it stops. On the surface of the Earth, this fireball bubble would grow to ten kilometers the second after it's detonated, as the atmosphere barely puts up a fight to hold it back. But the pressure at the bottom of\\nthe Mariana Trench is enormous. With 11 kilometres of water overhead, being in the Mariana Trench is like being crushed by a hydraulic press from every direction. Here, a second after the detonation, our bubble is about a kilometer across, when oddly enough, it starts to shrink. The bubble overextends itself, losing pressure as it expands, until the water turns it back, recompressing it. The tug of war between the fiery death bubble and water goes back and forth a few times, the bubble shrinking and growing, until eventually the bubble loses for good. The pressure around it is too great, and turbulent water begins to chop it up. It becomes something like the underwater equivalent of a mushroom cloud as it disintegrates into many smaller, hot and radioactive bubbles drifting upwards. And as our mighty destructive blast rises to the surface, it does basically nothing. Just a small wave, and a bubbling plume of radioactive warm water in the Pacific. No tsunami will wash away Japan or California, although boats and whales in the area might have a bad time. The radioactive fallout will be diluted into the Pacific after a few days, although a fair amount of radioactive water and salt makes it to the atmosphere where it collects and then rains down again. Even if the wind blows the fallout directly towards the Philippines, the worst of it probably happens over the oceans. But clearly, the real danger comes from our explosion-triggering earthquakes and volcanoes, right? Even if we detonated the bomb right in the trench at the exact point where tectonic plates touch, probably not. The explosion would vaporize a part of the seafloor, and turn a lot of sand into glass, but most of the energy goes into the water, not seismic waves. Earthquakes are already quite common at tectonic plate boundaries. And earthquakes with as much seismic energy as our bomb happen a few times a year without triggering any sort of apocalypse. But maybe it will affect the Earth's orbit. Since no mass is taken away or added to the Earth, our orbit is completely unaffected. Also, there have been well over a thousand nuclear tests in the last 70 years and that didn't change our orbit, so why would this time be different? The strongest forces humanity can unleash are laughable compared to the forces of nature. The planet is too big. It doesn't care. So, what happens to us if we detonate a nuclear weapon really deep in the ocean? Pretty much nothing. Did you know that every bird in our videos has an owner?

[Quacking] [Outro music]\", \"When the gods granted king Midas one wish, he wished that everything he touched would turn to gold. Midas was delighted. Trees, rocks, buildings all gold. But soon he found in horror that his food turned into gold as well. When he hugged his daughter to soothe his pain, he realized his mistake too late. The richest man in existence was starving, heartbroken and alone. Humanity got a similar wish granted when we learned how to turn brown stinky goo into magic - plastic. Cheap, sterile and convenient it changed our lives But this wonder of technology got a little out of hand. Plastic has saturated our environment. It has invaded the animals we eat and now it's finding its way into our bodies. [Catchy intro music] What is plastic? For most of our history humans used stuff we found in nature to build the things we needed. But the invention of plastic roughly 100 years ago completely changed our world. Plastic is made from polymers - long repeating chains of molecule groups. In nature, polymers exist everywhere : the walls of cells, silk, hair, insect carapaces, DNA. But it's also possible to create them. By breaking down crude oil into its components and Rearranging them, we can form new synthetic polymers. Synthetic polymers have extraordinary traits. They are lightweight, durable and can be molded into almost any shape. Not requiring time-consuming manual work, plastic can be easily mass-produced and its raw materials are a vailable in vast amounts And incredibly cheaply, and so the golden era of plastics began Bakelite was used for mechanical parts, PVC for plumbing electric gears and cases, Acrylic is a shatter resistant alternative to glass and nylon for stockings and war equipment Today almost everything is at least partly made from plastic. Our clothes, phones, computers, furniture, appliances, houses and cars. Plastic has long ceased to be a revolutionary material instead it became trash. Coffee cups, plastic bags, or stuff to wrap a banana. We don't think about this fact a lot. Plastic just appears and goes away. Unfortunately, it doesn't Since synthetic polymers are so durable, plastic takes between 500 and 1,000 years to break down. But somehow we collectively decided to use this super tough material for things meant to be thrown away. 40% of plastics are used for packaging. In the United States, packaging makes up 1/3 of all the waste that is generated annually. Since its invention, we have produced about 8.3 billion metric tons of plastic. 335 million tons in 2016 alone. More than 6.3 billion metric tons of plastic have become waste since 1907. Piled up in one place, that makes a cube with a side length of 1.9 kilometers. So what did we do with all this waste? 9% was recycled, 12% burnt. But 79% of it is sticking around still. A lot ends up in the ocean. Around 8 million tons a year. That's so much plastic that it will outweigh all the fish in the ocean by 2050. Because it's everywhere, marine animals keep getting trapped in plastic and swallowing it. In 2015 already 90% of seabirds had eaten plastic. Many animals starve with stomachs full of indigestible trash. In 2018 a dead sperm whale washed up in Spain. He had eaten 32 kilos of plastic bags, nets and a drum While this is tragic and makes for great magazine covers, there's an even more widespread, invisible form of plastic. Microplastics Microplastics are pieces smaller than 5 millimeters Some of them are used in cosmetics or toothpaste, but most result from floating waste that is constantly exposed to UV radiation And crumbles into smaller and smaller pieces 51 trillion such particles float in the ocean, Where they are even more easily swallowed by all kinds of marine life. This has raised concerns among scientists, especially about health risks from the chemicals that are added to plastic. BPA for example makes plastic bottles transparent But there's also evidence that it interferes with our hormonal system. DEHP makes plastics more flexible, But may cause cancer. It would be pretty bad if micro plastics are toxic, because they travel up the food chain. Zooplankton eat micro plastic. Small fish eat zooplankton. So do oysters, crabs and predatory fish and they all land on our plate. Micro plastics have been found in honey, in sea salt, in beer, in tap water and in the household dust around us. 8 out of 10 babies and nearly all adults have measurable amounts of phthalates, a common plastic additive in their bodies. And 93% of people have BPA in their urine There is little science about this so far and right now it's inconclusive. We need a lot more research before panic is justified. But it is safe to say that a lot of stuff happened that we didn't plan for. And we have lost control Over plastic to a certain extent which is kind of scary. But just to make sure we should simply ban plastics, right? Unfortunately, it's a bit more complicated than that. Plastic pollution is not the only environmental challenge we face. Some of the substitutes we'd use for plastic have a higher environmental impact in other ways. For example : according to a recent study by the Danish government, making a single-use plastic bag requires so little energy and produces far lower carbon dioxide emissions compared to a reusable cotton bag, that you need to use your cotton bag 7 thousand 100 times before it would have a lower impact on the environment than the plastic bag. We're left with a complex process of trade-offs. Everything has an impact somehow, and it's hard to find the right balance between them. Plastic also helps solve problems that we don't have very good answers for at the moment. Globally, one-third of all food that's produced is never eaten and ends up rotting away on landfills where it produces methane. And the best way of preventing food from spoiling and avoiding unnecessary waste is still plastic packaging. It's also important to note where the vast majority of the world's plastic pollution is coming from right now. 90% of all plastic waste entering the ocean through rivers comes from just ten rivers in Asia and Africa. The Yangtze in China alone flushes 1.5 million tons of plastic into the ocean each year. Countries like China, India Algeria or Indonesia industrialized at an impressive pace in the last few decades, transforming the lives of billions of people This development was so fast, that the garbage disposal infrastructure couldn't keep up with collecting and recycling all the new waste this brought If politicians in Europe and the US want to address this issue, investing in infrastructure in developing countries is just as important as fighting plastic pollution at home with campaigns and redesigning products to minimize unnecessary plastic production. The bottom line is, as long as we don't address plastic pollution from a global perspective, we will not solve it. Plastic pollution is a complicated problem. We found a magic material and we had a really good time with it, But we need to be careful or just like Midas, we'll end up in a world that we didn't wish for. Your individual daily actions still have a huge impact. What you do matters! Refuse disposable plastics. Convince your friends and family to do the same. Pressure companies and politicians to take the necessary steps to keep our oceans clean and our food safe. Together we can beat plastic pollution!

But is this really a good idea? In the online debate, the harmful sides are often downplayed. So let's look at the three most powerful arguments against legalizing marijuana. [Intro - Kurzgesagt] Argument number 1: In the last few decades, marijuana has been engineered\\nto become much more potent. Today, marijuana is so potent, that it's actually a strong drug\\nthat may cause psychosis. The main active ingredient of marijuana is THC, and there's strong evidence\\nthat THC is related to psychosis regardless of other risk factors. Marijuana also contains a substance called CBD, that seems to counteract its effect. It's even being tested as a treatment\\nagainst psychosis and anxiety. But because it doesn't make you high, growers have gradually decreased the amount of CBD in marijuana over the last few decades, while increasing THC levels. Sample testing showed that THC levels have risen from around 4% in the 1990s to nearly 12% in 2014, to nearly 12% in 2014, shifting the ratio of THC to CBD\\nfrom 1:14 in 1995 to about 1:80 in 2014. It's unclear how precise those tests were, however. Overall, recent findings suggest\\nthat the more marijuana you consume, and the stronger it is, the higher your risk of developing psychosis. But how high is the risk of psychosis\\nfor the general population? A study from Britain found that while marijuana use has risen significantly\\nbetween 1996 and 2005, the number of schizophrenia cases – a type of psychosis – remain stable. The risk of marijuana induced psychosis remains the highest for people who already have a high risk of psychosis to begin with. For them, it seems more likely that marijuana speeds up\\nthe development of their condition, rather than causing it,\\nas far as we know right now. So the reasoning goes, if fewer people have access to marijuana, the lower the risk of marijuana-induced psychosis. But actually, you could argue that precisely because marijuana is illegal, more people will end up with psychosis. Prohibition makes illegal drug stronger and more potent, because this way you can ship\\nmore product in a smaller space and sell it at a greater profit. This is what happened during\\nthe prohibition of alcohol in the US, where hard liquor became the norm. And the same is happening with marijuana now. Imagine a world where liquor\\nis the only alcohol available. You have the choice of either not drinking at all, or getting much drunker than you would like to. This is the situation for many marijuana smokers today. People didn't stop drinking during prohibition, and the numbers show that laws\\ndon't deter people from using marijuana. We can't make marijuana go away, but we can make it safer. If marijuana were legal, there would be more options for consumers, and regulators could, for example,\\ninsist on a high level of CBD. Just like most people don't drink\\nan after-work bottle of vodka, many people would gladly consume\\nthe after-work beer version of marijuana. Argument 2:\\nMarijuana is a gateway drug. If it's legalized, there will be a spike in the use\\nof much more dangerous drugs. A 2015 study found that about 45% of lifelong marijuana users took some other illegal drug at some point. Legalizing marijuana could reinforce this trend: As more young people try legal marijuana, they might end up trying harder drugs. But it turns out that the real gateway\\nto drug use comes much earlier: Cigarettes. One study showed that teens who started smoking before the age of 15 were 80% more likely to use illegal drugs\\nthan those who didn't. And a 2007 study found that teenagers\\nbetween 12 and 17 who smoked were three times more likely to binge drink, seven times more likely to have used\\ndrugs like heroin or cocaine, and were also seven times more likely\\nto resort to marijuana. But if that's the case, how could making more drugs legal\\nstop the use of hard drugs? At first, it's important to acknowledge that people don't use drugs because they're legal or not. If you want to buy any drug, you'll always find someone happy to sell. The real question is why do people develop an unhealthy relationship with drugs at all? Studies show that certain conditions make people especially vulnerable\\nto drugs and addiction. A difficult childhood, early trauma, low social status, depression, even genetic factors. Which drug they get addicted to\\nis more often than not a matter of chance. Addicts take drugs to escape their problems. But drugs don't solve any of those problems, and instead become a new problem. But punishing people\\nfor their unhealthy coping mechanisms doesn't change anything about\\nthe underlying causes either. So some argue we need to\\ntake a completely different route. In 2001, Portugal had one of the worst drug problems in Europe. So it was desperate enough to try something radical: Possession and use of\\nall illegal drugs was decriminalized. You would no longer be arrested; instead, authorities launched a major health campaign. People who were found with a small amount were referred to support services, and got help with treatment and harm reduction. Drug use was seen as a chronic disease, not a crime. The results were stunning: the number of people\\nwho tried drugs and kept using them fell from 44% to 28% by 2012. The use of hard drugs decreased, as well as HIV & hepatitis infections\\nand overdoses. Making drugs legal might overall\\nhelp society much more than it harms it. Argument number 3: Marijuana is addictive and unhealthy. It needs to remain illegal\\nto keep harm at a minimum. While marijuana addiction is\\nmore psychological than physical, it is still a real problem. The demand for treatment\\nfor marijuana addiction has more than doubled in the past decade alone. In total, about 10% of people\\nwho try marijuana will become addicted. This is also related to higher THC levels. A study released in 2017 tracked the potency of marijuana\\nin Dutch coffee shops over a period of 16 years. For every 1% increase in THC, 60 more people enter treatment nationwide. In terms of negative health effects, some studies linked marijuana use to\\nincreased blood pressure and lung problems, while a 2016 study found that\\nmarijuana use was unrelated to physical health problems,\\nexcept for a higher risk of gum disease. Some studies showed that\\nmarijuana use alters teenagers brains, and decreases their intelligence; but when more recent studies\\ntook drinking and smoking into account, the results were inconclusive. Overall, research shows that taking any drugs while the brain\\nis still in development is bad for you. But the truth is, we don't know yet\\nhow unhealthy marijuana is. We need more funding for research, which is hard to get while marijuana remains illegal. We can put what we know into perspective though. 16% of people who consume alcohol\\nbecome alcoholics, and 32% of people who try cigarettes\\nbecome smokers. We know for sure alcohol affects your brain, destroys your liver and causes cancer; while tobacco clogs your arteries, destroys your lungs and also causes cancer. 3.3 million people die from alcohol abuse each year, while smoking kills more than 6 million people. Nobody is suggesting tobacco and alcohol\\nare harmless just because they're legal. Also, nobody is seriously proposing to prohibit them even though they are extremely dangerous. Legality is a way to exercise some control over them, especially when it comes to protecting young people. It's often much harder to buy legal drugs\\nfor teenagers than to buy illegal ones. Official sellers can get hefty fines and lose their license if they sell to underage kids. Legality creates incentives here\\nthat drug dealers can't exploit. So making marijuana legal doesn't mean endorsing it. It means taking responsibility for the risks it poses. It could also open the floodgates\\nto tons of new research that shows us how harmful\\nit really is, and to whom. Conclusion: Marijuana is a drug, and just like any other drug,\\nIt has negative consequences for a sizable portion of the people who use it. It is not harmless. The best way to protect society\\nfrom its negative consequences seems to be legalization and regulation.

The war is fought by the single deadliest entity on our planet: the bacteriophage or 'phage' for short. [Intro + Music] A phage is a virus; not quite alive, not quite dead. Also, they look as if someone made them up. Their head is an icosahedron, a sort of dice with 20 faces and 30 edges. It contains the genetic material of the virus and often sits on a long tail that has leg-like fibers. There are more phages on earth than every other organism combined, including bacteria. And they are probably everywhere living things exist. Billions are on your hands, in your intestines and your eyelids right now. Which might make you nervous since phages are responsible for the majority of deaths on earth but you're lucky. While they do commit genocide for breakfast, they only kill bacteria. Up to 40% of all bacteria in the oceans are killed by them every single day. But phages also have major flaws. Like any other virus, phages need a host to survive and reproduce. They're not much more than genetic material in a hull and they specialize. Usually, a phage has chosen one specific bacteria and maybe some of its very close relatives. These are its prey. Imagine a phage as like a cruise missile that only hunts and kills members of one very unlucky family. When a phage finds its victim, it connects its tail fibers with receptors and uses a sort of syringe to puncture a surface. In a weird motion, the phage squeezes its tail and injects its genetic information. Within minutes, the bacteria is taken over. It's now forced to manufacture all the parts of new phages. They only stop when the bacteria is filled up with brand-new phages. In the final step, they produce 'endolysin', a powerful enzyme that punches a hole in the bacteria. The pressure is so high that the bacteria sort of vomits out all of its insides and dies. New phages are released and begin the cycle anew. In the last few years, bacteriophages have enjoyed the attention of the second deadliest beings on earth: humans. Recently, we've started looking into injecting millions of them into our bodies because we're sort of getting desperate; we screwed up. In the past a single cut or a sip from the wrong puddle could kill you. Bacteria were our phages. Tiny monsters that hunted us mercilessly. But then, about 100 years ago, we found a solution in nature. By accident, we found fungi that produced compounds that killed bacteria: antibiotics. Suddenly, we had a powerful super weapon. Antibiotics were so effective that we stopped thinking of bacteria as monsters. Only the old and the weakest among us were killed by them. We used antibiotics more and more for less and less serious causes. We lost respect for the monsters and the weapon But bacteria are living things that evolve and one by one they started to become immune against our weapons. This continued until we had created what are called 'superbugs', bacteria immune to almost everything we have. This immunity is spreading across the world as we speak. By 2050, superbugs could kill more humans a year than cancer. The days when a cut or bladder infection or a cough could kill you or your loved ones are coming back. In the US alone, more than 23,000 people die from resistant bacteria each year. But it turns out that phages, our tiny killer virus robots, could save us. We can inject them into our bodies to help cure infections. Hold on, how could injecting millions of viruses into an infection be a good idea? Phages are very very specialized killers of bacteria. So specialized, in fact, that humans are completely immune to them; we are too different. We encounter billions of phages every day and we just politely ignore each other. Antibiotics are like carpet bombing, killing everything even the good bacteria in our intestines that we don't want to harm Phages are like guided missiles that only attack what they're supposed to Wait a minute, if we use phages to kill bacteria, won't bacteria develop ways of defending themselves? Well, it's more complex than that; phages evolved too. There has been an arms race between them and bacteria for billions of years and so far, they're doing great. This makes phages smart weapons that are constantly getting better at killing. But even if bacteria were to become immune against our phage, we still might be able to win. It turns out that in order to become resistant to even just a few species of phages, bacteria have to give up their resistance to antibiotics. We might be able to trap them in a catch-22. This has already been successfully tested with a patient who had no other hope left The bacteria 'Pseudomonas Aeruginosa', one of the most feared bacteria, infected the man's chest cavity. They are naturally resistant to most antibiotics and can even survive an alcoholic hand gel. After years of suffering, a few thousand phages were directly inserted into his chest cavity together with antibiotics the bacteria were immune to. After a few weeks, the infections had completely disappeared. Unfortunately, this treatment is still experimental and pharma companies are still reluctant to invest the necessary billions in a treatment that has no official approval yet. But things are finally changing. In 2016, the largest phage clinical trial to date began and phages are getting more and more attention. and we better get used to it because the era in which antibiotics have been our super weapon is drawing to a close. It might be a weird concept but injecting the deadliest being on planet Earth directly into our bodies could save millions of lives This video was made possible by a grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation If you'd like to support Kurzgesagt, you can do so on patreon.com/Kurzgesagt and get fancy things in return.\", 'Black holes are the largest collections of pure violent energy in the universe. If you come too close, they\\'ll devour you and add your energy to their collection. And so, the energy is lost to us forever. Or is it? It turns out there\\'s a universe cheat code. A way of powering civilizations until the very death of everything, or of constructing the largest bomb in the universe. But how? Didn\\'t we learn that all energy is trapped forever in black holes, even light? This is true. Everything you think you know about the weirdest thing in the universe is about to get weirder, for one simple reason: Black holes are spinning. When really really massive stars die, their cores collapse under their own gravity into black holes. This means something very big becomes very, very tiny. Like the tiniest anything can be in this universe. But stars are rotating and a fundamental property of our universe is that things that are spinning don\\'t want to stop spinning. We call this: angular momentum. And this angular momentum can\\'t go away. A big thing that spins and becomes smaller, spins faster. So, as the core of a star collapses, its momentum makes it spin faster and faster and faster, until it collapses into a black hole . And the black hole keeps on spinning, inconceivably fast. Some of them spin millions of times a second. Just like non spinning black holes, ...spinning black holes have an event horizon and a singularity at their core, where all of their mass is concentrated. The singularity is usually described as a single infinitely small point with no surface area. But points can\\'t rotate, so a rotating singularity can\\'t be a point. Instead, it\\'s a RINGularity. A ringularity is a ring with a thickness of zero and no surface, spinning extremely fast, containing all the mass of the black hole. The black hole is spinning so fast, that it morphs space and time itself. It literally drags space with it, such is its power. This creates a new and super weird region of space-time: the Ergosphere, which envelops the black hole. If space and time are completely broken inside the event horizon, then they\\'re only half broken inside the ergosphere. Inside the ergosphere, nothing makes sense. It\\'s possible to enter it and then leave it again, but it\\'s probably not a great experience. You can imagine it like this: Falling into a static black hole is like sliding down a hole. Being inside the ergosphere of a spinning black hole is like spiraling down a deadly drain. The black hole transfers its own kinetic energy in the form of rotation, to everything that enters the ergosphere. The ringularity makes you dance whether you want to or not. You need to move faster than the speed of light just to stand still here, which is impossible. But here\\'s our cheat code: We can steal this energy, and there\\'s a lot of energy to steal. Take the supermassive black hole at the center of the Milky Way. We could steal as much energy from it as every single star in the Milky Way emits in a billion years combined. The easiest way to steal this energy is, oddly enough, to drop something into the black hole. We\\'ve seen that the ringularity forces energy on us when we enter the ergosphere, ...which is a lot like being in a whirlpool, with space-time rushing around and around. If you\\'re clever you can use the water to your advantage, and swim faster than before. In practice, this means sending a rocket into the ergosphere, and making a trade with the black hole: We give it some mass-energy, and it gives us some of its rotational energy. But it\\'s not a fair trade, we get the better deal. Normally, if you fire a rocket, you exchange chemical energy for kinetic energy. This is like pushing yourself forward in a swimming pool. But if you fire a rocket inside the ergosphere, it\\'s like pushing yourself forward in a wave pool. The rotational energy of the waves gives you a much stronger boost than you could get just by pushing yourself. The boost from the rotation of the back hole is so big, that you leave the ergosphere with much more energy than you entered it. The black hole gives a tiny amount of its rotational energy to you, and slows down a little. Obviously, this requires a lot of food. Fortunately, black holes aren\\'t picky eaters. An advanced future civilization would probably harvest asteroids to drop them into the black hole when they needed an energy boost. But there\\'s an even better way to get energy from a black hole, and oddly enough, it builds the biggest bomb any living thing could ever hope to build: We only need two things to build a black hole bomb: a fast-spinning black hole, and a big mirror. The mirror has to completely envelop the black hole, ...which is similar to a Dyson Sphere, a mega structure that harvests the energy of an entire star. Although, our mirror would be easier to build. Mirrors are simpler, and black holes are much, much more compact than stars. If we made the mirror 10 centimeters thick, the metal of a big asteroid would probably be enough material for a black hole with the mass of our Sun. Once our mirror is in place, we only need to open a window, and shoot electromagnetic waves at the black hole. You can imagine what happens next, by imagining tossing a ball at a wall, and it coming back faster than a bullet. The waves hit the black hole at light speed. A small proportion of the waves falls past the event horizon to disappear forever. But a much larger amount sloshes through the ergosphere, ...where the black hole forces some of its rotational energy on them, and amplifies them. They now begin superradiant scattering, which are fancy science words meaning: \"Bouncing around between mirror and black hole and getting stronger.\" Every time they go around, they are getting exponentially stronger. By opening some windows in the mirror, we can extract the energy from the waves as fast as they grow. Which we could use, in theory, to create what would be for all practical purposes, an endless source of energy for trillions of years. Or, we could blow it up. If the waves are not released, they will continue to get stronger and stronger, ...and take more and more energy from the black hole, until the mirror shatters. A supermassive black hole would release as much energy as a supernova, ...making the bomb the largest explosion any living being could ever create. The beauty of the black hole bomb, the Penrose process, and the super radiant scattering, is that they are not science-fiction. In the far far future, this might be the only way to survive in our dying universe. After all the red dwarfs have cooled down, and all the white dwarfs transformed into black dwarfs, the universe will turn dark forever. Rotating black holes might be the only sources of energy in the entire universe that life could harvest. If so, the last living being in existence might one day end its life around a black hole. Which is equally chilling and uplifting. It turns out that even without any light, there are places we can go.', \"What is the true nature of the universe? To answer this question, humans come up with stories to describe the world. We test our stories and learn what to keep and what to throw away. But the more we learn, the more complicated and weird our stories become. Some of them so much so, that it's really hard to know what they're actually about. Like string theory. A famous, controversial and often misunderstood story, about the nature of everything. Why did we come up with it and is it correct? Or just an idea we should chuck out? To understand the true nature of reality, we looked at things up close and were amazed. Wonderous landscapes in the dust, zoos of bizarre creatures, complex protein robots. All of them made from structures of molecules made up of countless even smaller things: Atoms. We thought they were the final layer of reality, until we smashed them together really hard and discovered things that can't be divided anymore: Elementary particles. But now, we had a problem: They are so small that we could no longer look at them. Think about it: what is seeing? To see something, we need light, an electromagnetic wave. This wave hits the surface of the thing and gets reflected back from it into your eye. The wave carries information from the object that your brain uses to create an image. So you can't see something without somehow interacting with it. Seeing is touching, an active process, not a passive one. This is not a problem with most things. But particles are But particles are very, But particles are very, very, But particles are very, very, very small. So small that the electromagnetic waves we used to see are too big to touch them. Visible light just passes over them. We can try to solve this by creating electromagnetic waves with more and much smaller wavelengths. But more wavelengths, means more energy. So, when we touch a particle with a wave that has a lot of energy it alters it. By looking at a particle, we change it. So, we can't measure elementary particles precisely. This fact is so important that it has a name: The Heisenberg uncertainty principle. The basis of all quantum physics. So, what does a particle look like then? What is its nature? We don't know. If we look really hard, we can see a blurry sphere of influence, but not the particles themselves. We just know they exist. But if that's the case, how can we do any science with them? We did what humans do and invented a new story: A mathematical fiction. The story of the point particle. We decided that we would pretend that a particle is a point in space. Any electron is a point with a certain electric charge and a certain mass. All indistinguishable from each other. This way physicists could define them and calculate all of their interactions. This is called Quantum Field Theory, and solved a lot of problems. All of the standard model of particle physics is built on it and it predicts lots of things very well. Some quantum properties of the electron for example have been tested and are accurate up to 0, 0,00 0,0000 0,000000 0,00000000 0,0000000000 0,000000000000 0,0000000000002 %. So, while particles are not really points, by treating them as if they were, we get a pretty good picture of the universe. Not only did this idea advance science, it also led to a lot of real-world technology we use everyday. But there's a huge problem: Gravity. In quantum mechanics, all physical forces are carried by certain particles. But according to Einstein's general relativity, gravity is not a force like the others in the universe. If the universe is a play, particles are the actors, but gravity is the stage. To put it simply, gravity is a theory of geometry. The geometry of space-time itself. Of distances, which we need to describe with absolute precision. But since there is no way to precisely measure things in the quantum world, our story of gravity doesn't work with our story of quantum physics. When physicists tried to add gravity to the story by inventing a new particle, their mathematics broke down and this is a big problem. If we could marry gravity to quantum physics and the standard model, we would have the theory of everything. So, very smart people came up with a new story. They asked: What is more complex than a point? A line- A line or a string. String theory was born. What makes string theory so elegant, is that it describes many different elementary particles as different modes of vibration of the string. Just like a violin string vibrating differently can give you a lot of different notes, a string can give you different particles Most importantly, this includes gravity. String theory promised to unify all fundamental forces of the universe. This caused enormous excitement and hype. String theory quickly graduated to a possible theory of everything Unfortunately, string theory comes with a lot of strings attached. Much of the maths involving a consistent string theory does not work in our universe with its three spatial and one temporal dimensions. String theory requires ten dimensions to work out. So, string theorists did calculations in model universes. And then try to get rid of the six additional dimensions and describe our own universe But so far, nobody has succeeded and no prediction of string theory has been proven in an experiment So, string theory did not reveal the nature of our universe. One could argue that in this case string theory really isn't useful at all. Science is all about experiments and predictions. If we can't do those, why should we bother with strings? It really is all about how we use it. Physics is based on maths. Two plus two makes four. This is true no matter how you feel about it. And the maths in string theory does work out. That's why string theory is still useful. Imagine that you want to build a cruise ship, but you only have blueprints for a small rowing boat. There are plenty of differences: the engine, the engine, the materials, the engine, the materials, the scale. But both things are fundamentally the same: Things that float. So, by studying the rowing boat blueprints, you might still learn something about how to build a cruise ship eventually. With string theory, we can try to answer some questions about quantum gravity that have been puzzling physicists for decades. Such as how black holes work or the information paradox. String theory may point us in the right direction. When used in this spirit, string theory becomes a precious tool for theoretical physicists and help them discover new aspects of the quantum world and some beautiful mathematics. So, maybe the story of string theory is not the theory of everything. But just like the story of the point particle, it may be an extremely useful story. We don't yet know what the true nature of reality is but we'll keep coming up with stories to try and find out. Until one day, Until one day, hopefully Until one day, hopefully, we do know. This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini.\", 'Homeopathy may be the most controversial but also the most popular alternative medicine. While some argue against it, others swear by its great power and effectiveness. How does homeopathy work? How did it become what it is today, and what can modern medicine learn from it? The first principle of homeopathy is \"like cures like.\" Remedies use ingredients that cause the symptoms you want to cure. In practice, that means that remedies against fever could, for example, be made from belladonna, which also causes fever. A mixture based from bee venom is used to treat itchy swellings, and so on. The second principle is the special method of preparation called potentization. The idea is that diluting and agitating the ingredients activates their curative powers and enhances their effect. To do this, the ingredient is dissolved in alcohol or distilled water. Homeopaths take one part of the solution and mix it with nine parts of water, diluting it down to one tenth of its original concentration, and shaking it. What you have now is a 1X potency---one part ingredient and nine parts solvent---named after the Roman numeral X, for 10. one-part ingredient and nine parts solvent, named after the Roman numeral X, for 10. Now, this process is repeated. Take one part, mix it with nine parts of pure water and shake it vigorously. Now you have 2X. You do this again and again until you reach the desired grade of potency. The finished remedy is then taken orally, or sometimes it\\'s applied as little sugar pellets that are sold as globuli. A 20X potency, for example, is like dissolving one aspirin pill in the water volume of the whole Atlantic. But many are much more extreme, like 30C, for example. C means that the mixture has one part ingredient and 99 parts water. So the commonly sold 30C mixture means one part ingredient and ..one million billion billion billion billion billion BILLION If we wanted a globuli pill with a single atom of the original ingredient, then our pill would be the diameter of the distance between the Earth and the Sun. 150,000,000 kilometers A pill so massive, that it would collapse into a black hole under its own mass. Because of this, potentization is one of the biggest criticisms of homeopathy. The extreme dilution is supposed to make the ingredients more potent, but on a physical level, this doesn\\'t really make sense. Most homeopathic remedies are diluted so much that not a single atom of the active ingredient is left in them. The explanation of why the mixtures still work is that shaking the mixture after every dilution leaves behind a spirit-like essence of the ingredient. Basically, the idea is that water remembers what was put into it. But if this were true, then every substance that ever met a drop of water would leave an essence behind and lead to unpredictable effects when it was accidentally ingested. Think of all the stuff that lives and floats in the oceans. Every sip of water would be a supercharged homeopathic cocktail. So how did homeopathy become the most successful alternative medicine? In the 18th century, medicine was very different from today. Treatments like bloodletting left the patient worse off than before. So German physician Samuel Hahnemann wanted a non-invasive, natural way of healing and developed homeopathy. And, in fact, homeopathic hospitals were soon successful because doing no harm beats doing harm. Hahnemann imposed very strict rules on his patients. First you had to avoid coffee, tea, alcohol, spicy food, sweet food. No old cheese, no onions, no meat. No clothes made from sheep\\'s wool, but also no sedentary work, no sitting inside in stuffy air, no warm rooms, no riding horses, no napping, no playing games, no masturbation, and of course, no reading pornographic texts, and many more. Then, and only then, would his remedies work, according to the inventor of homeopathy. Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today. Of course, all of these instructions are ignored and not talked about today. Medicine has changed a lot in the last 150 years. Never before in human history have we enjoyed a comparable level of health. Never have we lived as long, and this is largely due to the new tools we\\'ve developed. Never have we lived as long, and this is largely due to the new tools we\\'ve developed. Modern diagnostics, double-blinded studies, and scientific evaluation to check and prove which stuff works. Thanks to these tools, after countless studies and reviews, we know beyond a shadow of a doubt that homeopathy does not have any effect beyond placebo. But even so, who cares why it works if it helps people? Maybe you tried it and felt better, or you know someone that got over a horrible disease while using homeopathic remedies, and there are plenty of reports of it working for children and animals. What do we make of these experiences? The Placebo Effect is very real and not imaginary. No matter how smart you are, you\\'re not immune to it. If people believe that something will help them feel better, their trust alone has the desired effect. And it\\'s been proven that the Placebo Effect can be transferred. Children and animals rely on their parents or keepers and are in tune to their emotions. If a parent has a lot of trust in a treatment and eases up, this can help a child relax and help relieve symptoms. This could also be observed with animals who react strongly to the body language cues of the people caring for them. But the most powerful tool of homeopathy is time. Our bodies are survival machines. Infections pass on their own after a few days. But if you take some remedy when you already feel sick, and then start getting better, it feels like it did indeed cure you, when actually, it would have happened anyway. The homeopathy industry likes to play the gentle alternative to Big Pharma. But the homeopathic industry IS Big Pharma. Billions of dollars are made with extreme profit margins. The homeopathy industry has its own lobby organizations and fights its enemies as hard as it can. A lot of money is on the line. Globally, the market is expected to reach over 17 billion by 2024. Some critics even argue that the homeopathic industry is bad for public health because it creates distrust in proven medicine. The belief in homeopathy correlates with skepticism about vaccinations. This can discourage people to seek the help they need when their lives or the lives of their children are on the line. But there is actually a key to the success of homeopathy that we could, and should, copy. The first consultation with a homeopath can take hours and is very personal. For a patient who\\'s already been on a pilgrimage from doctor to doctor, this level of attention and empathy can make a huge difference to their well-being, even if the conversation was not the point of the therapy. Modern medicine is efficient. It saves millions of lives each year. But it\\'s also a strictly organized system. Tight budgets force doctors and nurses to deal with lots of patients. Consultations need to be time-efficient, diagnoses made quickly, treatments fast, which can leave patients feeling invisible, scared, and left behind. This is what modern medicine can learn from homeopathy. It meets a human need that has been left unfulfilled. We need to make time for the individual again. See people, not numbers. But as important as empathy is, it\\'s not a substitute for actual treatment. Faith can move mountains, but sugar water can\\'t cure cancer.

Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish\\nin the oceans of Europa, and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great? Well, no. It would be horrible news, devastating even. It could mean that the end of humanity\\nis almost certain and that it might be coming soon. Why? Why would the most exciting\\ndiscovery of our lifetime be bad? Let us imagine the development of life, from its inception to us today, as a flight of stairs. The first step is dead chemistry\\nthat needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns,\\nstable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve. The second step is for our early life to\\nbecome more complex, able to build more complicated structures, and use the available energy\\nmuch more efficiently. On the next step, these cells combine\\nto become multicellular beings, enabling unbelievable variety\\nand further complexity. The step above sees the species\\nevolve big brains, enabling the use of tools, culture\\nand shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity. The species can now become the\\ndominant lifeform on its planet, and change it according to its needs. First shy attempts to leave its\\nplanet are happening. This is where we are now. It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every\\nniche it can. And since planets have a limited\\ncarrying capacity and lifespan, if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places\\nto spread to. So the steps above the current\\nones seem logical: colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach\\nother stars, to the possible final step:\\nbecoming a galaxy-wide civilization. It's very likely that this is a universal\\nprinciple for civilizations, no matter where they're from. If a species is competitive and driven\\nenough to take control over its planet, they'll probably not stop there. We know that there are up to 500 billion\\nplanets in the Milky Way, at least 10 billion Earth-like planets. Many have been around billions\\nof years longer than Earth. But we're observing zero\\ngalactic civilizations. We should be able to see something... ...but there's nothing. Space seems\\nto be empty and dead. This means something is preventing living\\nthings from climbing the staircase, beyond the step we're on right now. ...Something that makes becoming\\na galactic civilization extremely hard, maybe impossible. This is the Great Filter. ...A challenge or danger so\\nhard to overcome, that it eliminates almost every\\nspecies that encounters it. There are two scenarios: One means we are incredibly\\nspecial and lucky, the other one means we are doomed\\nand practically already dead. It depends on where the filter\\nis on our staircase: behind, or ahead of us? Scenario 1: Scenario 1:\\nThe filter is behind us. We are the first. If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take. Which step could it be? Is life ITSELF extremely rare? It's very hard to make predictions\\nabout how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things. There is no consensus. Some scientists think it develops everywhere\\nwhere the conditions are right; others think that Earth might\\nbe the ONLY living place in the universe. Another candidate is the step\\nof complex animal cells. A very specific thing happened\\non this step, and as far as we know, it happened\\nexactly once. A primitive hunter cell\\nswallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it,\\nthe two cells formed a union. The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the\\nenvironment and providing resources, while the smaller one used its\\nnew home and free stuff, to focus on providing a lot of extra\\nenergy for its host. With the abundant energy, the host cell\\ncould grow more than before and build new and expensive things\\nto improve itself, while the guest became the\\npowerhouse of the cell. These cells make up every\\nanimal on the planet. Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way, but not a single one, apart from us, has achieved our level of complexity. ...or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and\\nsophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels. But a big brain, is first and foremost, a very expensive evolutionary investment. They are fragile, they don't help in a fistfight with a bear, they cost enormous amounts of energy, and despite them, it took modern humans, 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks\\nto civilization. Being smart does not mean you get\\nto win automatically. Maybe intelligence is just not so great, and we're lucky that it worked out for us. Scenario 2: Scenario 2:\\nThe filter is ahead of us. Plenty of others died already. A Great Filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far. Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover. And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a Great Filter, but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization. On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye. If a Great Filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful, that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years. A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet, it's already on the path to self-destruction. Technology is a good way to achieve that. It needs to be something that's so obvious, that virtually everybody discovers it, and so dangerous, that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster. A large-scale nuclear war, nanotechnology that gets out of control, genetic engineering of the perfect super bug, an experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire. It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally (or purposely) destroys its creators. Or things that we can't even see coming right now. Or it's way simpler: species competitive enough to take over their planet necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources. Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion, are not fixable. And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere, they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time. Let's hope that that's not the case. If the filter IS ahead of us, our odds are really bad. What we can hope for. THIS is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible. The more common life is in the universe, and the more advanced and complex it is, the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us. Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming. Ruins of ancient alien civilizations... would be horrible. The best case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile, that Europa's oceans are devoid of life, and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents. ...That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life. Billions of new homes... waiting for us... to finally arrive.\", \"Let's shrink an elephant to\\nthe size of a mouse and enlarge a mouse, and make it\\nthe size of an elephant, because this is our video,\\nand we want to see what happens. First: our now tiny elephant, stumbles around\\nand then drops dead. Tiny elephant buddy is very cold; frozen\\nto death in minutes. Our giant mouse looks very uncomfortable\\nfor a moment, and then it explodes. leaving hot mouse insides everywhere. Why? Because of size. We are optimized to function precisely\\nfor the size we are, and would die horribly\\nin any other environment. But, why exactly? Why does our mouse explode, and can we do this to our\\nelephant too, if we try hard? Life on this planet is based on cells. Cells do vary in size. But they're pretty similar in their dimensions\\nacross all species. A blue whale doesn't have bigger cells\\nthan a hummingbird, just a lot more of them. Cells have to do a lot of stuff to stay alive. And they need energy to be able to do so. To get this energy, animal cells convert food\\nand oxygen into usable chemical energy. This happens in our mitochondria, the powerhouse of the cell. They're like little coal engines\\nthat spit out tiny ATP batteries, which the cell can use for almost\\neverything it needs to do. Just like an engine, mitochondria get\\nreally hot while working. In human skin cells, they reach a scorching 50 degrees Celsius. And some of our cells\\nhave up to 2,000 mitochondria which are radiating their heat into the cell. So, being alive generates a lot of heat. The more cells you have, the more heat\\nyour body generates in total. If our bodies didn't\\nfind ways of losing this heat, we would be cooked from the inside and die. But this is a problem for bigger animals because of the way bodies change as\\nliving beings scale up. Animals have 3 properties\\nhere that are important. Their length, their outsides or skin, and their insides, like organs, bones, and hopes and dreams. The thing that's hard to wrap your\\nhead around is that when things grow, their insides grow faster than their outsides. Imagine a fleshy cube. If you double the length of its sides, its surface and volume do not double. In fact, the surface is now 4 times\\nthe original size, and the volume of the cube\\n8 times the original size. Which is called the Square Cube Law, and has been annoying nature\\nfor billions of years. So why is this a problem for big animals? Because heat can only leave\\nan object via its surface. So if we make our mouse\\nthe size of an elephant, or 60 times longer, it has 3,600 times more surface\\nfrom which to lose heat. But it has 216,000 times more volume filled with trillions\\nand trillions of new hot mitochondria that produce more heat. A lot more insides; not that much more skin. Our mouse is very dead, very fast. But big things like elephants exist. So how do they deal with the heat? For one, they evolved ways to get rid of\\nenergy more easily like huge flat ears, that have a lot of surface\\nwhere heat can escape. But that's not enough. Nature's solution is actually very elegant. Elephant cells are much, much\\nslower than mice cells. The bigger an animal is,\\nthe less active its cells are. If we classify animals, by their\\nmetabolic rates, and compare that to their overall mass,\\nIt's clearly visible. It's not 100% accurate, but it is a good rule of thumb. Elephants are huge meat sacks filled with trillions and trillions of little coal ovens. So, they keep the ovens just active\\nenough to keep them running and never at full power. Their whole metabolism is slow. Things move at a nice chill pace. Small animals need to go\\nthe exact opposite way. If you're small, you\\nhave a lot of surface area compared to not a lot of volume. You don't have a lot of cell ovens and lose the heat\\nthey produce very fast. So very tiny mammals came up with\\na very extreme solution. Meet the Etruscan Shrew,\\nthe smallest mammal on Earth. A mole-like thing that's more closely\\nrelated to hedgehogs than to mice. With the body length of 4 centimeters, it only weighs about 1.8 grams - as much as a paperclip. It's a tiny ridiculous being. It would basically cool off immediately, so its cells run on overdrive to stay warm. Its tiny ovens are filled at maximum capacity. Its heart beats up to 1,200 times a minute, and it breathes up to 800 times a minute. This creates an extreme need for energy. So the shrew has to eat constantly. After only 4 hours without food, it starves to death. And while an African elephant consumes around 4% of its body weight\\nin food each day. Our shrew needs 200% of its body weight in food a day just to survive. Imagine having to eat\\n2,000 Big Macs a day more than one a minute. Fun for a while, but then not so much. So, a cubic centimetre of shrew\\nneeds 40 times more food than a cubic centimetre of elephant. If an elephant's cells suddenly become as active as\\nthe cells of a shrew a crazy amount of heat\\nwould be generated. All the liquids in the elephant\\nwould suddenly start boiling. And then it would explode in an impressive explosion of steaming\\nhot burning elephant parts. In reality, before an explosion occurred the proteins making up\\nour cells would probably be denatured, and stop producing heat. But a meat explosion is much more fun than melting an elephant\\ninto a massive hot goo. Regardless, the scaling of the speed of \\nmetabolism happens everywhere. Even in places we don't expect,\\nlike pregnant women. A baby in the womb of its mother behaves\\nas if it were a part of her. Its cells have about\\nthe same metabolic rate, the same speed of life, \\nas its mother's organs. It is truly a part of a bigger whole,\\nrather than an individual. Until it's not anymore. The very moment a baby is born,\\na switch is flipped and all its internal\\nprocesses speed up rapidly. 36 hours after birth, the baby's cells have the same activity\\nrate as a mammal its size. Babies literally transition\\nfrom being an organ to being an individual, in mere hours. But there's one thing where big and small things\\nare very similar: Heartbeats. Mammals tend to have a similar\\namount of heartbeats, over their lifetime. Typically around 1 billion. So, while the shrew and elephant\\nare very different, they share a similar number of heartbeats\\nover the course of their lives. Their speed of life is the opposite\\nand somehow still the same. And, for a video in which we made elephants\\nexplode for no good reason. This is the most romantic ending\\nwe could come up with.\", \"What if the state covered your cost of living, would you still go to work? Go back to school? Not work at all? What would you do? This concept is called a universal basic income or UBI And it's nothing less than the most ambitious social policy of our times in 2017, basic income is gaining momentum around the world First trials are ongoing or on their way and a growing number of countries are considering UBI as an alternative to welfare How would it work and what are the key arguments for and against? Right now people can't really agree. What universal basic income is or should be Some want to use it to eliminate welfare and Cupp bureaucracy Others want it as a free extra for existing programs, or even want it to be so high that work itself becomes optional For this video we'll talk mostly about the minimum basic income enough money to be above the poverty line in the US this means about $1,000 a month or $12,000 a year The money would not be taxed and you could do whatever you wanted with it in In this scenario UBI is a way of transferring the wealth of a society while still keeping the free market intact But if we hand out free money will people just spend it on booze and stop working? A 2013 study by the World Bank specifically examined if poor people waste their handouts on tobacco and alcohol if they receive it in the form of cash The clear answer, no they don't. The opposite is true Other studies have shown that the richer you are, the more drugs and alcohol you consume The lazy and drunk poor person is a stereotype rather than reality What about laziness? Universal basic income test runs done in Canada in the 1970s showed that around 1% of the recipients stopped working, mostly to take care of their kids On average people reduced their working hours by less than 10% The extra time was used to achieve goals like going back to school or looking for better jobs But if laziness and drugs are not a huge deal, Why doesn't our current welfare state solve poverty Welfare or unemployment programs often come with a lot of strings attached Like taking part in courses, Applying to a certain number of jobs a month or accepting any kind of job offer no matter if it's a good fit, or what it pays Besides the loss of personal freedom, these conditions are often a huge waste of time and only served to make the unemployment statistics Seem less bad Often your time would be much better spent looking for the right job continuing education or starting a business Another unwanted side effect of many welfare programs is that they trap people in poverty and promote passive behavior Imagine a benefit of $1,000 each month in a lot of programs if you earn a single dollar extra the whole thing is taken away If you take a job, that's paying $1200 you might not only lose your benefits, but because of your taxes and another costs like transportation You might end up having less money than before So if you actively try to better your situation, and your total income is not improving or even a shrinking welfare can create a ceiling that traps people in poverty and rewards passive behavior A basic income can never be cut and  therefore getting a job and additional income would always make your financial situation better Work is always rewarded instead of a ceiling it creates a floor from which people can lift themselves up But even if UBI is the better model, is it economically feasible? What about inflation? Won't prices just rise making everything just like it was before? Since the money is not being created by magic or printers it needs to be transferred from somewhere It's more of a shift of funds than the creation of new ones Hence; no inflation Ok, but how do we pay for it? There's no right answer here because the world is too diverse How well-off the country is, what the local values are, Are things like high taxes or cutting the defence budget politically acceptable or not? How much welfare state is already in place and is it effective? Each country has its own individual path to a UBI The easiest way to pay for a UBI is to end all welfare and use the free funds to finance it Not only would this make a number of government agencies disappear, which in itself saves money, it would also eliminate a lot of bureaucracy on the other hand cutting them could leave many people worse off than before If the goal is to have a foundation for everybody there still need to be programs of some sort because just like countries, People are not the same The second way - higher taxes especially for the very wealthy In the US for example there's been a lot of economic growth but most of the benefits from it have gone to the richest few percent the wealth gap is rapidly widening and many argue that it might be time to distribute the spoils more evenly to preserve the social peace There could be taxes on financial transactions, capital, land value, carbon, or even robots But UBI is not necessarily expensive According to a recent study a UBI of $1,000 per month in the US Could actually grow the GDP by 12% over eight years because it would enable poor people to spend more and increase overall demand What about the people who do the dirty work? Who will work in the fields, crawl through sewers, or lift pianos? If you don't need to for survival, will people still do hard boring and unfulfilling labor? UBI might give them enough leverage to demand better pay and working conditions a study calculated that every extra dollar going to wage earners would add about $1.21 to the national economy While every extra dollar going to high-income Americans would add only 39 cents There would still be very rich and poor people but we could eliminate fear, suffering, and existential panic for a significant part of the population Making poor citizens better off could be a smart economic tactic For some this isn't enough. They want a UBI large enough to live a middle-class existence If we set the financial obstacle aside, this idea fundamentally challenges, how our society is constructed By earning money, you earn the possibility to take part in society this determines your status and options But it also forces many people into spending huge chunks of their time on things they don't care about in 2016 only 33% of US employees were engaged at work 16% were actively miserable and the remaining 51% were only physically present Would 67% of people stop working if they could? It would be unfair to portray work as just a chore work gives us something to do. It challenges us it motivates us to improve, it forces us to engage Many find friends or partners at work, we work for social status wealth and our place in the world We're looking for something to do with our lives and for many people work gives them meaning There are other concerns with UBI If all welfare programs were exchanged for one single payment, this gives the government a lot of leverage individual programs are easier to attack or cut than a multitude or populist smite promise drastic changes to the UBI to get into power and a universal basic income doesn't tackle all problems when it comes to equality Rents for example while $1,000 might be great in the countryside, it's not a lot for expensive metropolitan areas which could lead to poor people moving outwards and the difference between rich and poor becoming even more extreme and of course, for some people, the concept of work itself not being essential for survival is appalling Conclusion So is the universal basic income a good idea? The honest answer is that we don't know yet There needs to be a lot more research more and bigger test runs We need to think about what kind of UBI we want and what we're prepared to give up to pay for it The potential is huge. It might be the most promising model to sustainably eliminate poverty It might seriously reduce the amount of desperation in the world and make us all much less stressed out This video was made possible by a Universal basic income provided by you, our viewers Ten thousand people around the world gift us a monthly income on patreon.com/Kurzgesagt You enable us to pay salaries and buy new hardware you enable us to make more videos And you enable us to spend more time on them Kurzgesagt would truly not be what it is today without your help You help us stay independent, and you give us the freedom to put quality before quantity Thank you so much\", \"Health is the most valuable thing we have in life, but we tend to forget that until we lose it. We're living longer than ever before, which is great, but an unforeseen consequence of this is that we also spend a larger and larger portion of our lives being sick. Getting old currently means spending more time in pain. So scientists are trying to shift the attention of the medical community from optimizing lifespans to optimizing healthspans, the part of our lives during which we're disease free. To do this, we need to attack the root cause of almost all bodily defects: aging itself. Unbeknown to most people, the science of aging has made enormous progress In the last few years, with human trials about to begin in the near future. Let's look at three examples of discoveries that might benefit people who are alive right now INTRO 1: senescent cells. Your cells have an expiration date. Each time one of your cells divides, it copies its chromosomes. Because of the way this works, they lose a tiny bit of DNA at the ends. This could be catastrophic, so to protect themselves we have long segments of DNA called telomeres that sort of act like the stiff bits at the end of shoelaces, but they shrink with every cell division. In some cells, after a number of divisions the telomeres are gone, and the cell becomes a zombie, a senescent cell. Senescent cells stay around and don't die. The older you get the more of them are inside you. They harmed tissue around them and are linked to many diseases that accompany old age like diabetes and kidney failure. But what if you could kill them off? Scientists genetically engineered mice so that they could destroy their senescent cells as they pleased. Older mice without senescent cells were more active. Their hearts and kidneys worked better, and they were less prone to cancer. Overall, they lived up to 30 percent longer and in better health than average mice. Since we can't genetically engineer all the cells in the human body, we need to find another way to get rid of our senescent cells. But how do we kill them without harming healthy cells? Most cells in the body commit a programmed cell suicide when they're damaged, but senescent cells don't. It turns out that they underproduce a protein that tells them when it's time to die. So in a late 2016 study, mice were given an injection of this protein. It killed 80 % of all their senescent cells, while causing almost no harm to healthy cells. The treated mice became generally healthier and even regrew lost hair. As a result, there are a number of new companies looking at treatments involving senescent cells and the first human trials will start soon. 2: NAD+ Cells are made of hundreds of millions of parts. They're the structures, machines, messages, and the catalysts that make reactions happen. All these parts constantly need to be destroyed, cleaned up, and rebuilt. As we age, this process becomes less effective and so parts become crumpled, bunched up, or are removed slower, or they are no longer produced in the quantities we need. One of these parts is NAD+, a coenzyme that tells ourselves to look after themselves. At age 50, we only have about half as much in our bodies as we do at age 20. Low amounts of it are linked to a whole bunch of diseases from skin cancer to Alzheimer's, cardiovascular disease, and multiple sclerosis. But NAD+ can't enter cells so we can't get it as a pill. But scientists notice that other more flexible substances could enter cells and would then turn into an NAD+ inside. In 2016, multiple trials on mice showed that they boosted the multiplication of skin, brain, and muscle stem cells. They were rejuvenated, had a higher ability to repair their DNA, and had a slightly increased lifespan, This even got NASA interested, which is looking for a way to minimize the DNA damage astronauts would be exposed to from cosmic radiation on Mars missions. There are human trials being planned right now, but it's too soon to say if this will boost our healthspan or even lifespan. But NAD+ is a serious candidate and could become the first human anti-aging pill. 3: stem cells Stem cells are like cell blueprints that sit at various places in the body and copy themselves to produce a steady flow of fresh young cells, but they decline as we age and so we decline too. Without new parts, human bodies break. In mice, scientists observed that as the stem cells in their brains disappeared, they started to develop diseases So they took stem cells from baby mice brains and injected them directly into the brains of middle-aged mice, more specifically the hypothalamus, a polyp that's involved in regulating a lot of bodily functions. The fresh stem cells reinvigorated older brain cells by secreting micro RNAs that regulated their metabolism. After 4 months, brain and muscles worked better than those of untreated mice and on average, they lived ten percent longer. Another study took stem cells from mice embryos and injected them directly into the hearts of older mice. As a consequence, they had improved heart function, could exercise 20% longer, and weirdly enough their hair regrew faster. Conclusion What all of this tells us is that there is not a single magic bullet with which to cure aging. It requires a complex array of different therapies. We can kill off senescent cells to clear away the junk, give ourselves fresh new stem cells to fill the gap, all while regulating the metabolism of the other cells using medication. This video comes with a big caveat. After all, these studies have been carried out on mice. There's no guarantee the same therapies would work in us to the same extent, but they are proof of concepts. To learn more about how we can modify our own healthspan, we need human trials. We've only covered a tiny part of the research that's being done right now, and only scratched the surface of these ideas. The field of healthspan extension needs more attention and funding. If it gets it, all of us might enjoy growing old without pain If you now want to support the research on aging directly, you can do so at lifespan.io, a community of people actively supporting the scientists working to cure aging.

And do you think you'll change your mind once you reach that age? Fifty thousand years ago most humans died very young. As we learned how to use the resources around us to treat ourselves, this got better and better. Today, humans are living longer and healthier lives than ever before. But this has an unforeseen consequence. We spend an ever-increasing part of our lives being sick and in need of care. Most of us will die in a hospital bed, which is depressing enough by itself. But we also have to witness the same happening to our loved ones. Except, maybe we can stop this forever. The most effective way to treat a disease is to prevent it. It saves many more lives if you stop a million people from smoking, than coming up with better chemotherapies. So why not put a halt to the cause of all disease: the process of aging. In a nutshell, aging is caused by physics, and not biology. Think of cars. Parts wear down from rubbing and grinding. Metal rusts. Filters get plugged. Rubber cracks. Our bodies are worn down by trillions of tiny physical processes. Oxygen, radiation from the sun, our metabolism. Our bodies have many mechanisms to repair this damage, but over time they become less effective. So our bones and muscles weaken. Our skin wrinkles. Our immune system gets weaker. We lose our memory and our senses diminish. There's no such thing as dying of old age. We all die because one of our important parts breaks. The older we get, the more damaged and fragile we become until one or multiple diseases take over and kill us. Unnoticed by most of us, longevity research has made some unprecedented advances in the last few years. For the first time, we're starting to understand the mechanisms behind aging and how to manipulate them. Aging is neither mystical nor inevitable, and we might be able to stop or delay it during your lifetime. We'll discuss the science behind it and how scientists are trying to stop it in another video. But first, if we could, should we end aging? Is this a good idea? The end of aging or life extension makes many people uncomfortable. We're born, are young, become older, and then we die. This has been the natural order for literally all of human history, and getting old is a good thing, right? We celebrate the idea of living long enough to experience old age. We even call them the golden years. But the reality is that everybody wants to become old, but nobody wants to be old. Think of the Greek myth of Tithonus for example. Tithonus was the lover of the goddess Eos and probably an amazing dude, because she begged Zeus to grant him immortality, so they could spend eternity together. But she forgot to specifically ask for eternal youth. Tithonus was granted eternal life, but he kept aging, unable to die. After a few hundred years, he was reduced to the size of a grape, babbling on senselessly forever. Thousands of years ago, humans already feared never-ending old age. But ending aging does not mean getting weaker and weaker. If you become too old, it's too late. A 90 year old who stopped aging would die anyway after a few years. Too much damage has been done to his internal machinery. There are already too many surfaces for disease to attack. Instead, the concept of life extension promises to end diseases, and with them, the end of a fixed maximum age. We don't know how much we could prolong our lives. We might make every human healthy to the currently accepted maximum age of around 120, or we might stop biological aging and disease indefinitely. Nobody knows at this point what's possible. Okay, but even if we could achieve that, should we? Well, life extension is really just another phrase for medicine. All the doctors are doing is trying to prolong life, and minimize suffering. The vast majority of healthcare resources are spent on the consequences of aging. Nearly half of your lifetime healthcare costs will be spent during your senior years, and another third during middle age. We are actually already trying to prolong life with our current medicine. We're just doing it very inefficiently. Trying to stop aging from happening is not less natural than transplanting a heart, treating cancer with chemotherapy, using antibiotics or vaccines. Nothing humans do nowadays is purely natural anymore, and we enjoy the highest standard of living ever as a consequence of that. What we're doing right now is waiting until it's too late and the machine is failing. And then we use the vast majority of our resources trying to fix it as well as we can, while it breaks down even further. But life extension still feels hubristic. Most people assume that they will want to die once they reach a certain age, and this might still be true. The idea of avoiding death entirely is off-putting for many. The end of biological aging would not be in the end of death in any way. It's more like a summer evening when you were a kid, and your mom called you inside. You just wanted to keep playing, have a little more fun during sunset before you went to sleep. It's not about playing outside forever, just a little longer, until we feel tired. If you imagine a world without disease where you and your loved ones could live in good health for another 100 or 200 years, how would this change us? Would we take better care of our planet if we knew we would be around longer? If we could work for 150 years, how much time would we spend figuring out what we're good at? How much more time would we spend learning? Would the intense feeling of pressure and stress many of us are feeling right now, go away or get worse? So asking again, if you could choose how long to live right now, in good health and with your friends and family, what's your personal answer? What would you like your future to look like?

Our senses and brains can only\\nprocess a fraction of the world. So we have to use concepts and tools, to\\nlearn about the true nature of reality Technological progress not only widened\\nour knowledge about the universe, it also made us aware of unsettling possibilities. In the future, it might become possible\\nto simulate entire universes. But if this is an option, how can we know\\nthat it's not already happened? What if we are not creators, but creations? Is it possible that we are not real,\\nand we don't even know it? If our current understanding of physics is correct, Then, it's impossible to simulate the whole universe,\\nwith its trillions and trillions of things. But we don't actually need to, anyway. We only need enough universe to fool\\nthe inhabitants of our simulation, into thinking that they're real. Who needs billions of galaxies? We only need the space our\\nsubjects are allowed to explore. The vast universe could just be a flat projection, and they would have no way to know. What about small things like cells or bacteria? We don't really need them. When you use a microscope, what you\\nsee could be instantly created. Same with atoms the chair you're sitting\\non right now does not need to be simulated with quadrillions of atoms. We just need the outermost layer of it, it might be empty inside, until you\\ndecide to break it open. Your body might feel like it's filled with bubbly things,\\nbut it might be empty, until you open it. The minimum requirement for our simulation,\\nis only the consciousness of our virtual humans. Our subjects just need to think the simulation is real. Okay, so are we being simulated? Well, maybe, but there are a few\\nconditions that need to be met. Obviously, we have no authority over this topic,\\nso please take everything we say with a grain of salt. Based on a modified version of the original\\nsimulation argument by Nick Bostrom, we have five assumptions for you. If they're true, you dear viewer are living in a simulation. Assumption one, it's possible to simulate consciousness Nobody knows what consciousness is. For the sake of argument, let's assume that you could generate consciousness by simulating a brain. Brains are pretty complex. If you count every interaction between\\nsynapses as one operation, your brain runs at about ten to the power of seventeen, for one hundred million billion operations, per second. Let's generously assume we need ten\\nto the power of twenty operations, to simulate one second of human consciousness. But, we don't want to simulate just one human... We want to simulate all of human history at once,\\nso we can skip around. Let's say we want to simulate two hundred billion humans, with an average life span of fifty years. One year has thirty million seconds times fifty years times two hundred billion humans times ten to the power of twenty operations. So we need a computer able to handle million,\\ntrillion, trillion, trillion operations per second. More operations than there are stars\\nin the observable universe. The computer like this is just impossible. Except, maybe it isn't. Assumption two, technological progress will not stop anytime soon. If we assume that technological progress continues\\nin a similar fashion as it has so far, then there might be galaxy spanning civilizations,\\nwith unlimited computer power at some point. Beings on a technology level so advanced, that we\\ncould barely distinguish them from god's. A computer that can handle a million trillion, trillion, trillion operations is serious business, but there are actually concepts for computers,\\nwhich could handle this. The Matrioshka Brain, is the theoretical megastructure, made up of billions of parts orbiting a star,\\nfeeding on its radiation. A computer of this scale, would have enough\\npower to simulate many thousands, if not millions of humanities, at the same time. Other technologies, like high-end future quantum computers might lower the size drastically, so it might be possible to do this with a structure the size of a large city, or even smaller. But, only if there's still someone around\\nto build the computer. Assumption three, advanced civilizations don't destroy themselves. If there is a point at which all civilizations destroyed themselves, this whole discussion ends here. Looking into space, you'd expect to universe filled,\\nwith millions of alien civilizations, but we see nobody. the reason for this might be, Great Filters. Great Filters are barriers life has to overcome,\\nlike nuclear war, asteroids, climate change or a black hole generator. If life is inherently self-destructive,\\nthen there are no simulations. We explain this in more detail, in our \\nFermi Paradox video. Assumption four, super advanced civilizations, want to run simulations. When we speak of posthuman civilizations,\\nwe don't know what we're dealing with To think we know what beings as powerful\\nas gods want, is pretty arrogant. Imagine the smartest ant on earth living\\nnext to an amusement park, It's curious about what humans are up to, \\nso you try to explain. Unfortunately, the ant just doesn't understand. The concept of rollercoasters and standing\\nin lines and holidays and fun, doesn't make sense to an ant living an ant life. It's the same with us and a posthuman being, compared to them, we are ants. Running simulations for fun or science,\\nmight be an absurdly stupid idea to them. But, if they do want to run simulations for whatever reasons and assumptions one, two, three are true too, then the chances are not zero that you\\nare living inside a simulation. Assumption five, if there are a lot of simulations, you are\\nprobably inside a simulation. if there are simulated civilizations,\\nIt's likely that there are a lot of them. After all, we assume that post human beings have access to practically unlimited computing power. So if they run simulations, it would be convenient\\nto run millions or even billions of them. If there are billions of simulated universes, there are probably trillions and trillions of simulated conscious beings. which would mean that the vast majority of all conscious beings that will ever have existed, are simulated. So, for every conscious being made of flesh,\\na billion simulated ones exists. Since we have no way of knowing if we are simulated or not, in this case, the chances of you being one\\nof the nine hundred and ninety nine million nine hundred and ninety nine thousand nine hundred ninety nine simulated ones, are pretty high. So, what you consider reality, might not be real at all You really might be... simulated. All of this is based on a lot of assumptions\\nthat we can't really test right now So many scientists disagree with\\nthis whole thought experiment. So don't burn your house down to test \\nif there will be glitches. If you are simulated, not that much changes for you you might be on a small planet speeding\\nthrough eternal nothingness, or a simulation inside a computer. your existence does not become\\nmore or less scary and bizarre. All we can hope to do is try to live good lives,\\nand have a good time. And hope that if we actually are simulations\\nin a supercomputer, nobody trips over the power cable. Oh, oh, oh no, I think I just unplugged the simulation But what if that doesn't matter, what if we are in one right now? What if you are simulated? Jake, over at Vsauce3 is looking into that.

Short answer: you die.\\nLong answer: it depends which piece of the Sun. Like most of the matter in the universe, \\nour Sun is neither solid, liquid or gas, but plasma. Plasma is when stuff is so hot that the nuclei and electrons can separate and flow around freely,\\nwhich creates a goo like substance. So, you can imagine our Sun as an extremely big, spherical ocean of very hot goo. The deeper you, go the denser and weirder the goo becomes. So let's bring 3 samples (each the size of a house), \\nto our lab here on Earth and see what happens. First sample: \\nthe chromosphere. The chromosphere is the atmosphere of the Sun, \\na layer of sparse gas up to 5,000 kilometers deep, that's covered in a forest of plasma spikes that can be almost as big as Earth. It's pretty hot here between 6,000 and 20,000 degrees Celsius, but if we brought a solvent of it to Earth, we're not really getting our money's worth. Where we take our sample, the chromosphere is over a million times less dense than air. So, compared to our atmosphere at sea level,\\nit's basically the same as bringing the vacuum of space down to Earth. The moment our sample arrives, it would immediately be crushed by Earth's atmospheric pressure and implode. Air would rush to fill the vacuum and use as much energy as 12 kilograms of TNT in the process. This creates a high pressure shockwave, which shatters glass, ruptures ear drums, and maybe some internal organs. If you're standing too close it could kill you, so you'd better keep your distance Let's go deeper. Second sample, the photosphere Beneath the chromosphere, is the glowing surface of the Sun: the photosphere, which produces the light we see. It's covered in a grid of a million hot spots called granules. Each of them about as big as the United States, and over 5,000 degrees Celsius. These granules are the tops of convective columns, churning gas that brings the heat up from the center of the Sun to its surface. In these columns, a few hundred kilometres down, we take our second plasma sample. It has about the same pressure as our atmosphere on earth Though still much less dense for there. Its heat supports it, so it won't implode. Our sphere now carries twice as much energy, as much as 25 kilograms of TNT, that this time as heat. For a dazzling instant, this plasma would glow with a million times the brightness of the Sun seen from Earth, instantly lighting fires throughout our lab, but a few milliseconds later. Those fires are all that's left. The plasma has cooled to harmless gas, floating up from the flaming ruins. What if we go deeper? Third sample. The radiative zone. Here, the plasma is about two million degrees Celsius, and so dense and tightly packed, that it creates a sort of maze for itself. Energy in the form of photons tries to escape, but has to wander for hundreds of thousands of years, bouncing endlessly from particle to particle, until it eventually finds an exit. Bringing matter from here to our lab, is what experts call, a very bad idea. As soon as it arrives in our lab, the extreme pressure that holds the plasma tightly together is gone, and the material explodes with the power of a thermonuclear weapon. Our lab as well as the city around it will be destroyed in an instant. On the bright side, there won't be any radioactive fallout. With our lab destroyed, we can abandon the illusion that we're trying to do any science today. What if we go much, much deeper? Last sample. The core Here in the central 1% of the star, we find a third of the sun's mass. The matter here is compressed by the weight of the entire star above it. In the center of the core, the temperature is 15 million degrees, hot enough to make helium by smashing together hydrogen, powering the Sun by nuclear fusion. In billions of years after the death of the Sun, this core will remain as a white dwarf. If we brought a sample of it to Earth, it would cause a lot of inconvenience The biggest nuclear weapon ever detonated, had an energy of 40 megatons of TNT, or a cube the size of the Empire State Building. Our sample has the equivalent of 4,000 megatons. This is four billion tons of TNT, or a cube 1.3 kilometers high. To give you a sense of scale this is the cube inside Manhattan. Once the sphere arrives on Earth, this super dense matter expands instantly and creates an explosion with the force of well, the Sun. If we get the sample in Paris, in the morning the citizens of London would see what looks like a second sunrise. But, one that gets brighter and brighter, and hotter and hotter, until London burns to ashes. In a radius of about 300 kilometres around the blast, everything would be burnt. The shockwave would travel around the Earth multiple times. Most buildings in Central Europe would be flattened, eardrums would rupture, and windows break across the continent. The explosion would be apocalyptic. possibly humans civilization ending. If humans did survive, we could count on the dust blown into the atmosphere to create a small ice age. So, if there is one tiny bright side, it would be that the explosion might be an effective way to control human-caused climate change for a few decades. While this is definitely a good thing, all in all we conclude, that we should not try to bring the Sun to earth\", \"Black holes are the most powerful things in the universe, strong enough to rip whole stars into atom sized pieces Well, this is scary enough. They have an even more powerful and dark property: they might delete the universe itself. Black holes in a nutshell A black hole appears when an extraordinary amount of matter is concentrated in a tiny space. At their center, gravity is almost infinitely strong and whatever gets too close is ripped into its elementary particles. Not even light can escape black holes, and so we perceive them as spheres of blackness. If you were to fall into a black hole, nothing bad would happen until well after you crossed its outer border: the event horizon. You can imagine this as swimming in a river that ends in an enormous waterfall. As you float along, imperceptibly, the stream gets faster and faster, even if you can't see the waterfall yet. You could swim to safety, until without even noticing it, you cross the point of no return. No matter how fast you try to swim now, the stream will pull you towards certain death. Nothing can escape a black hole waterfall once it gets too close. This border completely separates black holes from the rest of the universe: we can't access them unless we're willing to never return. So there's no way of telling what's really going on inside black holes, but we have a few ideas about what's going on right at their very edges. Black holes radiate their mass away, like a hot pot on a stove losing its water as steam. This is called Hawking radiation. Black holes constantly lose an extremely tiny amount of their mass, a process that's unbelievably slow. It will take a black hole with a mass of our sun 10,000 billion billion billion billion billion billion years to lose 0.0000001% of its mass. This is happening constantly and unstoppably, and as it goes on it speeds up more and more. In the far far future when the last star in the universe has been dead for trillions of years, black holes will become tinier and tinier until they evaporate and disappear, leaving behind just a bit of radiation. But this is a problem, because in the process of disappearing black holes might delete something fundamental: information. 2 - What is information? Information is nothing tangible. It's typically understood as a property of the arrangement of particles. What does this mean? Imagine a bunch of carbon atoms. Arrange them in a certain way and you get coal. Arrange them in a different way, and you get a diamond. The atoms are the same, what changes is the information. If we make this more complex and add in a few more atoms, we get a banana. Change the arrangement of the atoms, and we get a squirrel. The basic building blocks of everything in the universe are the same, and don't care if they're part of a bird or a rock or a cup of coffee. Without information everything in the universe would be the same. According to the theory of quantum mechanics information is indestructible. It might change shape, but it can never be lost: for example if you burn a piece of paper, you get ash. That ash will never become paper again. But, if you were able to carefully collect every single carbon atom in the ash, and measured the exact properties of the smoke and heat radiating from the fire, you could, in theory reconstruct the paper. The information of the paper is still in the universe. It's not lost, it's just hard to read. If you could somehow measure every single atom and particle and wave of radiation in the universe, you could see and track every bit of information there is. Hypothetically, you could see the entire history of the universe right back to the Big Bang. And here black holes trip us up. Information tells us how things are different from each other and what used to be what. Black holes do the opposite: they take different things and make them the same. They destroy information. This creates the information paradox, and this is a serious problem. The information paradox It's fundamental for all our laws of physics that information can never be lost. Existing, not existing. Without information, everything is relative. When it comes to our understanding of reality, we need absolutes. How could we solve this paradox? There are a few possibilities. 1) Information is lost. Irretrievably and forever. This means we have to nix all our laws of physics, throwing out a lot of stuff that's worked very well so far and to start from scratch What those new laws of physics would look like, or what that means for us, nobody knows. This is a little frightening, but also kind of exciting. 2) Information is hidden. Maybe a little part of the black hole splits off and forms a baby universe. The information would be transferred into this new weird place, where we could never observe or interact with it, but technically it would not be lost. It's like having a broken hard drive with all your family photos, that you could never access. Sure, it's nice that they've not been deleted, but also not very helpful. Or maybe black holes don't disappear completely after the end of their life cycles, but a little piece is left, an information diamond. like a clown car filled with an infinite amount of information clowns. But there's a third option: Information is safe after all, not lost or hidden. Perhaps we've just been looking at this whole thing the wrong way. We know that black holes trap information and might delete it later, but we never thought about what they do with it in the meantime. Where do black holes store their information? Cosmic housekeeping Let's create a black hole with dirty laundry. First, we fill up a room with laundry baskets: the more laundry you want to store, the more baskets you put in the room. But at some point every single basket is full, and the room is completely stacked, not a single extra sock fits in. The room is at maximum capacity. But if we still squeeze the sock in with a lot of energy and violence, the room collapses in on itself and forms a black hole. But the capacity of the room itself has not changed, fitting in more stuff or information is still impossible. So what happens if we throw more laundry into it? The room itself gets a little bit bigger to make space for the new information. It turns out a black hole grows its surface by a tiny pixel for each bit of information we throw into it. In a nutshell, more information means more surface area. The information gets painted on the surface, similar to what happens when we throw a stone into a pond. After the stone sinks to the bottom we can't see it anymore, but we can tell that something went in from the ripples on the surface of the pond. Even the smallest black hole can store more information on its surface than all the data ever produced in human history. They do this by storing information in a type of pixel that is unbelievably tiny. Black holes are the ultimate hard drive. This is a bit like taking a paper back, and turning it into an e-book, two things that look completely different. But their content is the same -- it's just encoded and memorized in another way. Black holes swallowing stars and planets is a bit like transferring a whole library onto an e-reader. This solution is called the holographic principle, but if it's correct then everything we thought we knew about the universe is wrong. The universe is a hologram If information is actually stored on the boundary of a black hole, the Hawking radiation has a chance of learning about the information encoded there, and can carry it away. So, information is not lost when black holes fade away, and we do not need to redo physics: the information paradox is resolved. But we still have to change our understanding of reality in a fundamental way. If everything that falls into the black hole is stored on its event horizon, that basically means that three-dimensional stuff is encoded on a flat surface. We have a name for this: a hologram. A hologram is like a 3D photo, a flat piece of plastic that encodes a three-dimensional image. A black hole is like a hologram, because everything inside it is encoded on its event horizon. A person inside a black hole will experience their usual three-dimensional life. but for us on the outside they are flattened images on the surface of the black hole. The consequence of this is counterintuitive, but stay with us for a moment. Black holes are very extreme objects, but they're still bound to the same rules as everything else. So if this crazy duality between 2D and 3D works for black holes, then it might work for the whole universe, and you in it. Since a person inside a black hole would not realize that they're encoded on a flat surface, we might share the same fate: you really might be stretched over a flat screen at the end of the universe. The science behind this is complicated and really weird, with toy universes to play with, string theory and a lot of maths. We'll talk about this more in another video. Regardless of what the true nature of the universe really is, we just know that it's strange and complicated, and we have to do a lot more physics to understand it. But black holes might be key to understanding the nature of reality itself. This video was supported by the Swiss National Science Foundation, and realized with the scientific advice of Alessandro Sfondrini.\", \"Let's start this video by throwing a\\nmouse, a dog, and an elephant from a skyscraper onto something soft. Let's say, a stack of mattresses. The mouse lands and is stunned for a moment, before it shakes itself off, and walks away pretty annoyed, because that's a very rude thing to do. The dog breaks all of its bones and dies in an unspectacular way, and the elephant explodes into a red puddle of bones and insides and has no chance to\\nbe annoyed. Why does the mouse survive, but the elephant and dog don't? The answer is size. Size is the most underappreciated \\nregulator of living things. Size determines everything about our biology, how we are built, how we\\nexperience the world, how we live and die. It does so because the physical laws are\\ndifferent for different sized animals. Life spans seven orders of magnitude,\\nfrom invisible bacteria to mites, ants, mice, dogs, humans, elephants and, blue\\nwhales. Every size lives in its own unique universe right next to each other,\\neach with its own rules, upsides, and downsides. We'll explore these different\\nworlds in a series of videos. Let's get back to the initial question: Why did our\\nmouse survive the fall? Because of how scaling size changes everything; a principle that we'll meet over and over again. Very small things, for example,\\nare practically immune to falling from great heights because the smaller you\\nare the less you care about the effect of gravity.\\nImagine a theoretical spherical animal the size of a marble. It has three\\nfeatures: its length, its surface area, (which is covered in skin) and its volume,\\nor all the stuff inside it like organs, muscles, hopes and dreams. If we make it\\nten times longer, say the size of a basketball, the rest of its features\\ndon't just grow ten times. Its skin will grow 100 times and it's inside (so it's\\nvolume) grows by 1000 times. The volume determines the weight, or more accurately,\\nmass of the animal. The more mass you have, the higher your kinetic energy\\nbefore you hit the ground and the stronger the impact shock. The more\\nsurface area in relation to your volume or mass you have, the more the impact\\ngets distributed and softened, and also the more air resistance will slow you\\ndown. An elephant is so big that it has extremely little surface area in ratio\\nto its volume. So a lot of kinetic energy gets distributed over a small space and\\nthe air doesn't slow it down much at all. That's why it's completely destroyed in\\nan impressive explosion of goo when it hits the ground. The other extreme,\\ninsects, have a huge surface area in relation to their tiny mass so you can\\nliterally throw an ant from an airplane and it will not be seriously harmed. But\\nwhile falling is irrelevant in the small world there are other forces for the\\nharmless for us but extremely dangerous for small beings. Like surface tension\\nwhich turns water into a potentially deadly substance for insects. How does it\\nwork? Water has the tendency to stick to itself; its molecules are attracted to\\neach other through a force called cohesion which creates a tension on its\\nsurface that you can imagine as a sort of invisible skin. For us this skin is so\\nweak that we don't even notice it normally. If you get wet about 800 grams\\nof water or about one percent of your body weight sticks to you. A wet mouse\\nhas about 3 grams of water sticking to it, which is more than 10% of its body\\nweight. Imagine having eight full water bottle sticking to you when you leave\\nthe shower. But for an insect the force of water surface tension is so strong\\nthat getting wet is a question of life and death.\\nIf we were to shrink you to the size of an ant and you touch water it would be\\nlike you were reaching into glue. It would quickly engulf you, its surface\\ntension too hard for you to break and you'd drown. So insects evolved to be water\\nrepellent. For one their exoskeleton is covered with a thin layer of wax just\\nlike a car. This makes their surface at least partly water repellent because it\\ncan't stick to it very well. Many insects are also covered with tiny hairs that\\nserve as a barrier. They vastly increase their surface area and prevent the\\ndroplets from touching their exoskeleton and make it easier to get rid of\\ndroplets. To make use of surface tension evolution cracked nanotechnology\\nbillions of years before us. Some insects have evolved a surface covered by a\\nshort and extremely dense coat of water repelling hair. Some have more than a\\nmillion hairs per square millimeter when the insect dives under water air stays\\ninside their fur and forms a coat of air. Water can't enter it because their hairs are\\ntoo tiny to break its surface tension. But it gets even better, as the oxygen of\\nthe air bubble runs out, new oxygen diffuses into the bubble from the water\\naround, it while the carbon dioxide diffuses outwards into the water. And so\\nthe insect carries its own outside lung around and can basically breathe\\nunderwater thanks to surface tension. This is the same principle that enables\\npond skaters to walk on water by the way, tiny anti-water hairs. The smaller you get\\nthe weirder the environment becomes. At some point even air becomes more and\\nmore solid. Let's now zoom down to the smallest insects known, about half the size\\nof a grain of salt, only 0.15 millimeters long: the Fairy Fly.\\nThey live in a world even weirder than another insects. For them air itself\\nis like thin jello, a syrup-like mass surrounding them at all times.\\nMovement through it is not easy. Flying on this level is not like elegant\\ngliding; they have to kind of grab and hold onto air. So their wings look like\\nbig hairy arms rather than proper insect wings. They literally swim through the\\nair, like a tiny gross alien through syrup.\\nThings only become stranger from here on as we explore more diversity of\\ndifferent sizes. The physical rules are so different for each size that\\nevolution had to engineer around them over and over as life grew in size in\\nthe last billion years. So why are there no ants the size of horses?\\nWhy are no elephants the size of amoeba? Why? We'll discuss this in the next part. We have a monthly newsletter now, sign up if you don't want to miss new videos and\\nfor bonus videos.\", \"Human existence is scary and confusing. A few hundred thousand years ago, we became conscious and found ourselves in a strange place. It was filled with other beings. We could eat some; some could eat us. There was liquid stuff we could drink; things we could use to make more things. The daytime sky had a tiny yellow ball that warmed our skin. The night sky was filled with beautiful lights. This place was obviously made for us. Something was watching over us. We were home. This made everything much less scary and confusing. But the older we got, the more we learned about the world and ourselves. We learned that the twinkling lights are not shining beautifully for us, they just are. We learned that we're not at the center of what we now call the universe, and that it is much, much older than we thought. We learned that we're made of many little dead things, which make up bigger things that are not dead, for some reason, and that we're just another temporary stage in a history going back over a billion years. We learned, in awe, that we live on a moist speck of dust moving around a medium-sized star in a quiet region of one arm of an average galaxy, which is part of a galaxy group that we will never leave. And this group is only one of thousands that, together, make up a galaxy supercluster. But even our supercluster is only one in thousands that make up what we call the observable universe. The universe might be a million times bigger, but we will never know. We can throw words around like two hundred million galaxies or trillions of stars or bazillions of planets, but all of these numbers mean nothing. Our brains can't comprehend these concepts. The universe is too big. There is too much of it. But size is not the most troubling concept we have to deal with. It's time, or, more precisely, the time we have. If you're lucky enough to live to one hundred, you have five thousand two hundred weeks at your disposal. If you're twenty-five now, then you have three thousand nine hundred weeks left. If you're going to die at seventy, then there are two thousand three hundred and forty weeks left - a lot of time, but also ... not really. And then what? Your biological processes will break down, and the dynamic pattern that is you will stop beinge dynamic. It will dissolve until there is no you left. Some believe that there is a part of us we can't see or measure, but we have no way to find out, so this life might be it and we might end up dead forever. This is less scary than it sounds, though. If you don't remember the 13.75 billion years that went by before you existed, Then the trillions and trillions and trillions of years that come after will pass in no time once you're gone. Close your eyes. Count to 1. That's how long forever feels. And as far as we know, in the end, the universe itself will die and nothing will ever change again. Our videos induce existential dread in many people, and the last few minutes probably haven't helped. So, for once, we want to offer a different way of looking at these things: an unscientific, subjective point of view, the philosophy of Kurzgesagt, if you want. Please take it with a grain of salt; we don't know any more about human existence than you do. We counter existential dread with optimistic nihilism. What do we mean by that? Well, to summarize, it seems very unlikely that 200 trillion trillion stars have been made for us. In a way, it feels like the cruelest joke in existence has been played on us. We became self-aware only to realize this story is not about us. While it is great to know about electrons and the powerhouse of the cell, Science doesn't do a lot to make this less depressing. Okay, but so what? You only get one shot at life, which is scary, but it also sets you free. If the universe ends in heat death, every humiliation you suffer in your life will be forgotten. Every mistake you made will not matter in the end. Every bad thing you did will be voided. If our life is all we get to experience, then it's the only thing that matters. If the universe has no principles, the only principles relevant are the ones we decide on. If the universe has no purpose, then we get to dictate what its purpose is. Humans will most certainly cease to exist at some point, but before we do, we get to explore ourselves and the world around us. We get to experience feelings. We get to experience food, books, sunrises, and being with each other. The fact that we're even able to think about these things is already kind of incredible. It's easy to think of ourselves as separated from everything, but this is not true. We are as much the universe as a neutron star or a black hole or a nebula. Even better, actually, we are its thinking and feeling part: the centre organs of the universe. We are truly free in a universe-sized playground, so we might as well aim to be happy and to build some kind of utopia in the stars. It's not as if we've found out everything there is to know We don't know why the rules of the universe are as they are, how life came into existence, what life is. We have no idea what consciousness is or if we are alone in the universe. But we can try to find some answers. There are billions of stars to visit, diseases to cure, people to help, happy feelings to be experienced, and video games to finish. There is so much to do. So, wrapping up, you've probably used up a good chunk of the time available to you. If this is our one shot at life, there is no reason not to have fun and live as happy as possible. Bonus points if you made the life of other people better. More bonus points if you help build a galactic human empire. Do the things that make you feel good. You get to decide whatever this means for you.\", \"How long do\\nyou think it will take before machines do your\\njob better than you do? Automation used to mean big stupid machines\\ndoing repetitive work in factories. Today they can land aircraft,\\ndiagnose cancer and trade stocks. We are entering a new age of automation\\nunlike anything that's come before. According to a 2013 study,\\nalmost half of all jobs in the US could potentially be automated\\nin the next two decades. But wait; Hasn't automation\\nbeen around for decades? What's different this time? Things used to be simple. Innovation made human work\\neasier and productivity rose. Which means that more staff\\nor services could be produced per hour using the same\\namount of human workers. This eliminated many jobs, but also\\ncreated other jobs that were better which was important because the\\ngrowing population needed work. So, in a nutshell, innovation,\\nhigher productivity, fewer old jobs, and many\\nnew and often better jobs. Overall, this worked well for a majority\\nof people and living standards improved. There's a clear progression in\\nterms of what humans did for a living. For the longest time,\\nwe worked in agriculture. With the Industrial Revolution, this\\nshift into production jobs and as automation became more widespread,\\nhumans shifted into service jobs. And then only a few moments ago in human\\nhistory, the Information Age happened. Suddenly, the rules were different.\\nOur jobs are now being taken over by machines much faster\\nthan they were in the past. That's worrying of course... but\\ninnovation will clearly save us, right? While new information age\\nindustries are booming, they are creating fewer\\nand fewer new jobs. In 1979, General Motors\\nemployed more than 800,000 workers and made about\\n$11 billion US dollars. In 2012, Google made about $14 billion US\\ndollars while employing 58,000 people. You may not like this\\ncomparison, but Google is an example of what created\\nnew jobs in the past: Innovative new industries. Old innovative industries are running\\nout of steam. Just look at cars. When they became a thing 100 years\\nago, they created huge industries. Cars transformed our way of life,\\nour infrastructure, and our cities. Millions of people found jobs\\neither directly or indirectly. Decades of investment\\nkept this momentum going. Today, this process is largely complete.\\nInnovation in the car industry does not create\\nas many jobs as it used to. While electric cars are great and all,\\nthey won't create millions of new jobs. But wait; what about the internet? Some technologists argue\\nthat the Internet is an innovation on a par of the\\nintroduction of electricity. If we go with this\\ncomparison, we see how our modern innovation differs\\nfrom the old one. The Internet created\\nnew industries, but they're not creating\\nenough jobs to keep up with population growth or to compensate for\\nthe industries the Internet is killing. At its peak in 2004, Blockbuster had 84,000 employees and\\nmade $6 billion US dollars in revenue. In 2016, Netflix had 4,500 employees and\\nmade $9 billion dollars in revenue. Or take us, for example. With a full-time team of just 12 people,\\nKurzgesagt reaches millions of people. A TV station with the same amount\\nof viewers needs way more employees. Innovation in the Information\\nAge doesn't equate to the creation of enough new\\njobs, which would be bad enough on its own but now, a\\nnew wave of automation and a new generation of machines\\nis slowly taking over. To understand this, we need to\\nunderstand ourselves first. Human progress is based\\non the division of labor. As we advanced over thousands of years,\\nour jobs became more and more specialized. While even our smartest machines\\nare bad at doing complicated jobs, they are extremely good at doing narrowly defined and predictable tasks. This is what destroyed factory jobs. But look at a complex job\\nlong and hard enough, and you'll find that it's\\nreally just many narrowly defined and predictable\\ntasks one after another. Machines are on the brink\\nof becoming so good at breaking down complex jobs\\ninto many predictable ones, that for a lot of people, there will be\\nno further room to specialize. We are on the verge of being outcompeted. Digital machines do this\\nvia machine learning, which enables them to acquire\\ninformation and skills by analyzing data. This makes them become better at something\\nthrough the relationships they discover. Machines teach themselves. We make this possible by\\ngiving a computer a lot of data about the thing we\\nwanted to become better at. Show a machine\\nall the things you bought online, and it will slowly learn what to recommend\\nto you, so you buy more things. Machine learning is now meeting more\\nof its potential because in recent years, humans have started to\\ngather data about everything. Behavior, weather patterns, medical\\nrecords, communication systems, travel data, and of course,\\ndata about what we do at work. What we've created by accident\\nis a huge library machines can use to learn how humans do things\\nand learn to do them better. These digital machines might\\nbe the biggest job killer of all. They can be replicated\\ninstantly and for free. When they improve, you\\ndon't need to invest in big metal things; you can\\njust use the new code. And they have the ability to\\nget better fast. How fast? If your work involves complex work on\\na computer today, you might be out of work even sooner than the people\\nwho still have jobs in factories. There are actual real-world examples of\\nhow this transition might be happening. A San Francisco company offers a\\nproject management software for big corporations, which is supposed to\\neliminate middle management positions. When it's hired for a new project, the\\nsoftware first decides which jobs can be automated and precisely where\\nit needs actual professional humans. It then helps assemble a team of\\nfreelancers over the Internet. The software then distributes tasks to\\nthe humans, and controls the quality of the work, tracking individual\\nperformance until the project is complete. Okay. This doesn't sound too bad. While this machine is killing one job,\\nit creates jobs for freelancers, right? Well, as the freelancers\\ncomplete their tasks, learning algorithms track\\nthem, and gather data about their work, and which\\ntasks it consists of. So what's actually happening, is that the freelancers are teaching\\na machine how to replace them. On average, this software\\nreduces costs by about 50% in the first year, and by\\nanother 25% in the second year. This is only one example of many. There are machines and\\nprograms getting as good or better than humans\\nin all kinds of fields. From pharmacists to analysts,\\njournalists to radiologists, cashiers to bank tellers, or the\\nunskilled worker flipping burgers. All of these jobs won't\\ndisappear overnight, but fewer and fewer humans\\nwill be doing them. We'll discuss a few cases\\nin a follow-up video. But while jobs disappearing is\\nbad, it's only half of the story. It's not enough to\\nsubstitute old jobs with new ones. We need to be generating\\nnew jobs constantly because the world\\npopulation is growing. In the past we have solved\\nthis through innovation. But, since 1973, the generation of new\\njobs in the US has begun to shrink. And the first decade of the 21st\\ncentury, was the first one, where the total amount of jobs in the US,\\ndid not grow for the first time. In a country that needs to create\\nup to 150,000 new jobs per month, just to keep up with\\npopulation growth, this is bad news. This is also starting to\\naffect standards of living. In the past, it was seen as\\nobvious that with rising productivity, more and better\\njobs would be created. But the numbers\\ntell a different story. In 1998, US workers worked\\na total of 194 billion hours. Over the course of the next 15 years,\\ntheir output increased by 42 percent. But in 2013, the amount of hours worked\\nby US workers was still 194 billion hours. What this means, is that\\ndespite productivity growing drastically, thousands of new\\nbusinesses opening up, and the US population growing by over\\n40 million, there was no growth at all in the number\\nof hours worked in 15 years. At the same time, wages for\\nnew university graduates in the US, have been declining\\nfor the past decade, while up to 40 percent of\\nnew graduates, are forced to take on jobs that\\ndon't require a degree. Productivity is separating\\nfrom human labor. The nature of innovation\\nin the Information Age is different from everything\\nwe've encountered before. This process started years ago\\nand is already well underway. Even without new disruptions like\\nself-driving cars, or robot accountants. It looks like\\nautomation is different this time. This time, the machines\\nmight really take our jobs. Our economies are based on\\nthe premise that people consume. But if fewer and fewer people have decent\\nwork, who will be doing all the consuming? Are we producing ever more cheaply\\nonly to arrive at a point where too few people can actually buy\\nall our stuff and services? Or, will the future see a tiny minority of\\nthe super rich who own the machines... dominating the rest of us? And does our future\\nreally have to be that grim? While we were fairly dark\\nin this video, it's far from certain that things\\nwill turn out negatively. The Information Age and modern\\nautomation, could be a huge opportunity to change human society, and reduce\\npoverty and inequality drastically. It could be a seminal\\nmoment in human history. We'll talk about this potential,\\nand possible solutions like a universal basic income, in\\npart 2 of this video series. We need to think big, and fast. Because one thing's for\\nsure, the machines are not coming; They are already here.\", \"Humans can survive in this universe as long as we have an energy source. Unfortunately, the universe will die. It will happen slowly, over many billions of years, but it will happen. On a universal time scale, stars like our sun will be gone in no time. Luckily, there are places that will exist practically forever from a human perspective: the corpses of dead stars... white dwarfs. They could be humanity's last home right before the death of the universe. What are these strange things and what happens when they finally die? How long stars live varies drastically, depending on how massive they are. For example, really massive stars burn hot and fast, dying violently in supernovae a few million years after birth. But they're the exception. 97% of all stars will end their existence as white dwarfs. There are two ways this can happen: Small stars - so-called red dwarfs - burn out over trillions of years until they eventually quietly turn into white dwarfs. Medium-sized stars like our Sun are more interesting. Imagine the sun as a huge pressure cooker that fuses hydrogen into helium in its core through its gravity. The fusion of elements releases extreme amounts of energy, that pushes outwards and stabilizes the star, keeping it in a delicate balance. When the Sun is old, the hydrogen in the core is exhausted, and the Sun will begin to burn helium into heavier elements. While doing so, it will shed its outer layers. When this process is over more than half of the Sun's mass will be lost into space as a spectacular planetary nebula millions of kilometers across. What remains will be its former core: A white dwarf is born, a star corpse. While its former self was about 100 times its diameter, now it's only about as big as Earth, but still with about half of its former mass. This means it's extremely dense, a teaspoon of white dwarf is about as massive as a car. Its surface gravity is over 100,000 times higher than Earth's. If you tried to land on it, you'd immediately be compressed into a steaming puddle. Life around a white dwarf is very unlikely, but possible. Most of them that exist now were former stars that, well, died, which probably ruined any planets they once had. But that's not all: since they are so small, a planet would need to orbit them about 75 times closer than Earth is to the Sun to have liquid water. This proximity has up- and downsides: for one, it would tidally lock the planet giving it a permanent day and permanent night. At the edges of these day and night zones life could be possible. But white dwarfs have a very stable energy output, so they might actually be safer to live around than many red dwarfs. This is still speculation at this point, but if we could find the white dwarf with the right conditions to settle around, we could have a home for many billions of years. But why do they shine so much longer than other star types? White dwarfs are very, very hot - up to 40 times hotter than our Sun - ranking among the hottest objects in the universe. But they are not incredibly active. All the heat inside of them is trapped and has nowhere to go. Only on its outer layer can it escape into space. But space is mostly empty, so heat can't be transferred by conduction. The only way energy can escape is by radiation. This is so inefficient that white dwarfs will take trillions of years to cool down, which may make them humanity's last refuge. They might be the last sources of light and energy in a dying universe. According to some estimates white dwarfs might shine as long as 100 billion billion years, ten billion times longer than the universe has existed. So far into the future that no regular stars will shine any more, galaxies will have evaporated, and only then will the first white dwarf turn into the first black dwarf. When this happens the last hope for life will die off. Black dwarfs will be inactive spheres with no energy left to give, still massive enough to kill you if you get too close. So cold that they'll be near the coldest possible temperature in the universe, so dark that they are practically invisible. The universe will enter its last stage - heat death - which will leave the universe unrecognizable, an absolutely dark and cold graveyard, with black holes and black dwarfs scattered over trillions of lightyears. We don't know for sure what will happen with black dwarfs in the end. If the proton - one of the fundamental parts of atoms - has a limited lifespan, black dwarfs will slowly evaporate over many trillions of years. If the proton does not decay, black dwarfs will probably turn into spheres of pure ion via quantum tunneling, over a timespan so obscenely gigantic that calling it forever is okay. These ion spheres will then travel completely alone through a dark universe. Nothing new will happen anymore... forever. While this may sound kind of dark, this is so far away that for our purposes today, it might as well not happen at all. It doesn't matter what happens in a billion trillion years. Right now, we happen to exist at an excellent time, able to be in awe about a universe filled with endless stars and light and planets. And enough time to visit them one day.

Many people feel a strong disconnect with the EU, while others praise its achievements. Everything considered: Is its existence good or bad for Europeans? Since it looks like the UK is leaving the EU, we'll mostly treat it as if it's no longer part of the club. The European Union, combining its 27 member countries, has a population of about 450 million people, making it the third most populous sort-of country in the world. It's the world's second largest economy by GDP, and has the biggest single market in the world. But originally, the creation of the European Union was all about one thing: Peace. Europeans are really good at war, so they were involved in bloody conflicts for basically all their history. A century-long rivalry between Germany and France alone, cost millions of lives and ran so deeply that Germans invented their own word for it: Erbfeindschaft. After the second World War, Europeans decided they wanted lasting peace that was not based on a balance of military power. Instead, the economies, politics, and peoples of Europe, should become so closely interconnected, that war would become both impractical and unthinkable. The plan worked! Between EU members, we've had over 70 years of peace. Okay, peace is great and all, but what are the European Union's achievements and problems? Today, EU citizens benefit from many individual freedoms. EU treaties and regulations ensure easy travel, cheap telecommunications, a great variety of goods and services, as well as very strong health and safety standards. European institutions are not afraid to pick a fight with companies such as Microsoft, Apple or Facebook about fair competition, tax evasion or data protection. Through the EU science programs, the European countries became a collaborative engine that serves as a hub of science in the wider world. Unrestricted travel and the right to work anywhere makes it easy to apply for funds, and set up international teams of experts with the best equipment. In turn, the EU became the world leader in terms of its global share of science researchers, and produces more than twenty-five percent of the world's research output, with only five percent of its population. But many citizens feel distrust toward the EU. Brussels seems far away and untransparent, technocratic, and difficult to understand. It doesn't help that the EU is terrible at outreach, and explaining what it actually does. This disconnect has also led to an ever-shrinking voter turnout over the decades. More transparency and accountability are desperately needed if the EU institutions want the trust of their citizens. Currently, the EU is still shaken by the refugee crisis of 2015. Some countries have accepted far greater numbers of asylum seekers than others, while the border countries are overwhelmed and feel left alone. Other countries are shocked by the initially unregulated mass immigration, and closed their borders, effectively shutting down the largest route into Europe. The EU's wealth and freedom make it an attractive destination, and this is unlikely to change. The population is split on how to react to that. Some argue that Europe let in too many immigrants, with a different culture without strictly demanding integration, while others argue that immigration is not the problem, but that racism and discrimination of immigrants is preventing integration. To strike a balance between helping refugees, turning illegal immigrants away, and successfully integrating the ones that stay, remains one of the most difficult and controversial challenges of the Union. Immigration aside,  many more challenges lie in the future, like defense. Traditionally, European countries have relied strongly on the protection of the US through NATO. But in the current political climate, Europe has to ask itself if it really wants to depend on the United States for its safety. If combined today, the militaries of EU members could form an effective defensive force and be the third largest military in the world. That could save a lot of money, safeguard European borders, and enhance cultural understanding with soldiers from 27 different countries serving one common purpose. What about money? Well, it's complicated. The EU created the largest single market in the world. Inside it, you can trade border and customs free. Countries that entered it got a massive boost to their economies. Even between neighbors, trade increased by up to five hundred percent, and there was a steady creation of new jobs. Research has suggested that joining the EU has left Most new members with an average of a twelve percent higher GDP than if they had remained outside. And for those regions with weaker economies and poor infrastructure, EU institutions provide billions of euros every year helping economic investment, infrastructure, and social development. On the negative side, the EU tries to hold together countries with vastly different economies and laws regarding labor, taxes and social security. The cost of one hour of work in an EU country ranges from four euros an hour to forty euros an hour. Some countries have large industries and strong exports while others focus on services, tourism, or natural resources. On top of this, the euro is the common currency of some but not all of these countries. As the Greek crisis shows, this can be a recipe for disaster. You cannot unify a vastly different economies under one currency, but their economic policies separate. So, should all EU countries unite under the common currency, or not? Should the weakest links be thrown out of the Euro, or should countries be made to adopt common policies on taxes, health care, and social security? It's a question that's been brewing for years, and is nowhere near a solution. So, everything briefly considered: Is the European Union worth it? Here is our answer: The EU is very flawed, and still needs a lot of work. But it's fair to say that the European Union makes Europeans powerful in the world. Put together, we lead in science, are one of the strongest economic powers, and could have one of the strongest militaries in the world. But more importantly, the EU gives us peace, security, and a sense of shared identity. And something we all crave in these turbulent times, stability. If we want to protect the values we're so proud of, a strong European Union is the best way to make sure our voice is heard in the world. Alone as small states, we'll hardly stand a chance in a world of shifting superpowers. What do you think about the EU in its future? In recent years, the discussion about political topics has become super toxic with sad real-world consequences. Let's not do that. If you don't agree with this video, you're not our enemy, you just have a different opinion and that's fine. We're all in the same boat after all, so let's have a fact-based discussion about our future.\", 'GMOs are one of the most controversial areas of science. Genetic engineering is used in many fields, but even though medical applications like GM insulin are widely accepted, The debate heats up when it comes to food and agriculture. Why is that? Why is the same thing treated so differently? Let\\'s try to get to the bottom of this and explore the facts, the fears, and the future of GMOs. Humans have been genetically modifing plants and animals for thousands of years. Maybe a few of your crops had very good yields. Maybe one of your wolves was especially loyal. So you did the smart thing, and bred the plants and animals that had traits beneficial to you. Traits suggest an expression of genes. So with each generation, those genes got more pronounced. After thousands of years, almost every single plant and animal around us is vastly different from its pre-domesticated state. If humans have been changing genes for millennia, what makes a so called \"Genetically Modified Organism\", or GMO, different? Selective breeding is basically hoping for lucky hits. Genetic engineering eliminates this factor. We can choose the traits we want. Make fruit grow bigger, immune to pests, and so on. So, why are people concerned about them ? Let\\'s start with one of the most common objections to GMOs. Gene flow, meaning GM crops could mix with traditional crops and introduce unwanted new characteristics into them. There is a method that might guarantee complete prevention, but is a big anti-GMO argument by itself. Terminator seeds. The idea is that they could produce sterile plants, requiring farmers to buy new seeds every year. The very concept of this, however, caused a public outcry, stopping the technology being put to use. This brings us back to the unintentional spreading of engineered DNA. There have been cases of GMOs growing where they weren\\'t planted, and traces of modified genes found in foreign crops. But GM plants can\\'t run wild entirely. Many crops pollinate themselves, and all crops have to be related to mingle. There are also cultural methods like buffer zones, to keep unintentional crossing at a minimum. But if it\\'s possible in principle that a GMO could unintentionally cross with a non-GMO, there\\'s actually a more important question. Is food that comes from GM crops different to food from non-GM crops? This question has been a major concern from the very beginning. GM plants that are destined to be eaten are checked for possible dangers, and the results are evaluated by multiple agencies. After more than 30 years and thousands of studies, the science is in. Eating GMO plants is no more risky than their non-GMO equivalent. But don\\'t just take it our word for it, the sources for this and other claims are in the video description. But what about plants that have been engineered to be toxic? For example, BT crops. A gene borrowed from the bacterium Bacillus Thuringiensis, lets engineered plants produce a protein that destroys the digestive system of specific insect pests. The plant makes its own pesticide. Insects that eat it die. That sounds alarming! Pesticide sprays could be washed off. While the poison in BT crops is inside the plant. But actually, it\\'s not a big deal. Poison is really just a question of different perspectives. What\\'s harmless to one species, might kill another. Coffee, for example, is a poison that kills insects but is harmless to us. Or take chocolate, it\\'s dangerous for dogs but a pleasure for humans. BT crops produce a protein that is tailored to the specific design of the digestive tract of certain insects; it\\'s completely harmless for us. There\\'s also the opposite approach. Plants that are engineered to be resistant to certain weed killers. This way, farmers can use them widely, killing the other plants competing for resources without harming the crop. Here, we get to the dark underbelly of GMOs. For the pesticide industry, they are big business. Over 90% of all cash crops in the US are herbicide resistant, mostly to glyphosate. As a result, the use of glyphosate has increased greatly. That isn\\'t only bad, glyphosate is much less harmful to humans than many other herbicides. Still, this means famers have a strong incentive to rely on this one method only, casting more balanced ways of managing weeds aside. That\\'s one of the most fundamental problems with the GMO debate. Much of the criticism of this technology is actually criticism of modern agriculture and a business practice of the huge corporations that control our food supply. This criticism is not only valid, it\\'s also important. We need to change agriculture to a more sustainable model. GMOs as a technology are actually an ally and not a enemy in that fight, helping to save and protect nature and minimize our impact on the environment. Let\\'s look at some positive examples. Eggplant is an important crop in Bangladesh but often, whole harvests are destroyed by pests. Farmers had to rely heavily on pesticides. Not only was this very expensive, Farmers also frequently got sick. The introduction of a new GM eggplant in 2013 stopped this. The same BT protein we talked about before, an effective killer of insects but harmless to humans, was engineered into them. This reduced insecticide use on eggplants by more than 80%. The health of farmers improved, and their income rose dramatically. And sometimes, the GM approach is the only option. In the 1990s, the papaya industry in Hawaii was under attack from the ringspot virus which threatened to wipe out Hawaiian papaya. The solution was a papaya genetically modified to be vaccinated against the virus. Without it, the state\\'s papaya industry would have collapsed. All these stories show a very narrow application. 99% of all GMOs we use right now produce pesticides, or are resistant against them. There is so much more we could do. The scientists are working on GMOs that could improve our diet. Plants that produce more or different nutrients, like fruit with higher antioxidant levels that help to fight diseases or rice with additional vitamins. On a larger scale, we\\'re trying to engineer plants more resilient to climate change, plants that can better adapt to erratic weather and adverse soil conditions, making them resistant to droughts or floods. GMOs could also not only reduce agriculture\\'s impact on the environment, but actively help to protect it. Scientists are working on crops that can draw nitrogen from the air, like microbes. Nitrogen is a common fertilizer, but its build-up pollutes the ground water and speeds up climate change. Plants that collect their own nitrogen could fix two problems at once. The over use of fertilizers in the developed world, as well as the shortage of it in developing countries. We could even modify plants to become super-effective carbon collectors,  like the American chestnut tree, to mitigate and actually reverse climate change. With the tools we have today, our imagination is the limit. The world eats 11 million pounds of food every day. A UN estimate suggests we\\'ll need 70% more by 2050. We could grow that food by clearing more and more forests to create fields and pastures and by using more pesticides. Or we find a way to do it on the land we\\'ve got right now, with more effective methods like GM crops. Intensifying farming instead of expanding it means GMOs could become the new organic. In a nutshell, GMOs have the potential to not only drastically change agriculture but to also dampen the effects of our own irresponsible behavior. GMOs could be our most powerful weapon to save our biosphere. This video took more than 600 hours to make, which would be impossible without viewer support on Patreon.com.

However, if our species wants to have a long term future, we have to escape our prison. But what is keeping us here in the first place? Turns out, we owe the universe a debt that is 4.5 billion years old. *Intro* Everything with mass in the universe attracts every other thing with mass. We call this phenomenon 'gravity'. The closer you are to a big chunk of mass, the stronger the attraction or the more you're pulled in. This effect traps us on earth. We can imagine this as being prisoners in a gravity prison, or a gravity well. It's not a literal well, but a handy concept to understand how this works. Being in a gravity prison means that you owe gravity energy. But how can you owe energy? Because in our universe, things don't want to change their speed or direction. To convince them to move, you have to expend energy. Billions of years ago, the gravitational attraction of trillions of trillions of dust particles orbiting our sun caught them together until they formed a planet. This process used energy and created the gravity well we're now a part of. The deeper you are inside the gravity well, the more energy you owe gravity. If you don't find a way to get enough energy, then you aren't able to leave no matter what you do. Because your atoms were once part of the dust that the universe expended energy on to get to this place. Ok. Hmm...Let's summarise all of that again. Objects in the universe don't like to move. You have to convince them to do so with energy. Gravity used energy to convince the parts of our planet to move together. This created a gravity prison in the process, trapping us . To escape, it we need to repay it with energy. Ok. How do we do that? To get into space, we need to go through a complicated process of exchanging energy. For this purpose, we build a negative potential energy repaying machine. Known By their more boring name 'rockets' Rockets work by using some of the most energetic chemical reactions humans know about to basically explode fuel in a controlled way. This converts chemical energy into kinetic energy. The exhaust of the reaction is directed outwards, and pushes the rocket away from Earth. By expanding a lot of energy, we are increasing our gravitational potential energy. Which is a complicated way to say that we are paying back our energy debt to gravity. But it's actually a lot trickier than that. When you burn fuel to get into orbit, you lose lots of energy to heat, exhaust and atmospheric drag ,so you actually need much more. And you can't just pile a huge amount of radioactive, really explosive, dangerous fuel close to your payload and detonate it. You need a controlled burn which is complicated and makes your rocket very heavy ...which means it has more mass. The more mass something has, the more energy you need to convince it to move, so you need more fuel to lift up your rocket. But,if you need more fuel, that means you need more rocket to carry that fuel! But, this makes your rocket heavier thus requiring more fuel which requires more rocket to carry that new fuel and so on. At the end of this madness, you need closer to a 100x the weight of your payload to launch Ariane 6, for example (the european rocket) will weigh 800 tons and should be able to transport 10 tons into geostationary transfer orbit or, 20 tons into medium earth orbit. But a rocket can only produce so much thrust, so there is a maximum weight, after which it just won't take off. If you add too much weight, it won't lift off. So, you can't just build bigger and bigger fuel tanks This is the tyranny of the rocket equation and it means space flight will never become easy. But wait, it gets worse. Getting to space is still not good enough- you're still inside the gravity prison at the edge of space and will crash back to Earth. Staying in space is much harder than getting there. To get to a stable position, where it can stay for  a while, a rocket has to reach low Earth orbit. To do this, you need a lot of kinetic energy which means going extremely fast at an altitude of about 100 km, this is 8 km/s 28,000 km/h is fast enough to travel around Earth in 90 minutes. Here, we can use a trick. Instead of flying straight up, we can go sideways! Earth is a sphere. So, if you're going sideways, fast enough (even though you're falling towards Earth) the ground will curve away beneath you. So, as long as you're above the atmosphere (about 100 km up) you'll be able to stay up there in orbit. This is what the ISS does (falling around Earth, expending energy form time to time) to stay fast enough. If we look at orbits in scale, we see that near Earth orbit is laughably close to Earth. To deploy, for eg Satellites, on leave for other planets, requires another round of energy debt repayment. Getting to orbit is the most difficult part of space flight for us right now. For example: If we want to send a rocket to Mars, half the energy is necessary just to get into orbit and the other half for the 55 million km to Mars. Therefore, to be as effective as possible, rockets aren't built in one giant piece. Instead, we use multistage rockets. We don't need to carry an empty fuel tank, so rockets drop it. Rockets today, shed their boosters and main stage as they ascend with each successive stage being it's own fully contained rocket, complete with its own engine and fuel. Ok. So this is why getting to space is hard. If you feel all of this seems really complicated, don't worry. It's literally rocket science!

And in an incredibly short amount of time.. ..We terraformed this planet and designed it to fit our needs. As far as we know, we're the first beings to awaken and completely take over a planet. The transition from hunting and gathering to farming and building, was so breathtakingly fast, that many of our ways of thinking about the world are no longer useful. One of our most outdated ideas is that the most commonly used calendar in the world insists that we live in the year of 2016. This distorts our view of our own history, and makes it harder to understand who we are as a species, and just how far we have come in an incredibly short amount of time. So, maybe it's time to choose a Year 0 for humanity. A Year 0 that truly represents us as a species and includes all cultures, a Year 0 that marks when we began building our own world on top of the old one. *Kurzgesagt intro* ~The 1st temple~ 12,000 years ago hundreds of humans came together in the hills of southern Anatolia. They were hunters and gatherers without the knowledge of agriculture or metalworking. All they had were tools made of stone and wood, but they built humanity's first big construction project.. ..7,000 years before the pyramids were built in Egypt. Spread over 300 meters our ancestors erected circles of massive stone pillars, each of them up to 6 meters high and 40 tons in weight. Decorated with art for pictograms and stone carvings of animals and mythical creatures. We have no idea how they were able to do this. It was probably a project of epic scale for the Stone Age, requiring a level of organization we didn't know.. ..early humans were capable of until we found this site. So, why did they build it? The most popular theory is that this was the first temple of humanity dedicated to long-forgotten Gods. We only know that this construction project, the 1st-of-its-kind marks the beginning of a new era. It's in this area, around that time, that humans truly began to build their own world. Which would make it a fitting milestone in our history, for the start of our calendar. This moment in time is so distinct, that scientist Cesare Emiliani proposed that humanity.. ..should switch to what he called the Holocene calendar, by adding 10,000 years to our current Gregorian calendar. We don't need to change our well-established days and months, and religious calendars could stay the same as well. But for all official purposes, our current year will be the year 12,016 of the human era. This would drastically alter how we think about history, and how it feels. Let's take a very brief look, and move through our new history, from our New Year 0. ~A new human history~ 12,000 years ago saw the beginning of the first construction project, kicking off our history. It would be in use for about 2,000 years. It took nearly a millennium until Jericho, probably the first city on Earth, was founded in the year 1000 after the start of the human era. Progress was still very, very, slow at this point. Over the next 1,000 years more and more.. ..permanent settlements appeared around the world, and more and more plants and animals were domesticated as agriculture spread. Evidence for trade over thousands of kilometers has been found from this period. Around 5,000,000 humans were alive at this point in history, fewer than live in London today. Technology advanced constantly, at a slow pace. Pottery became widespread. The first cultural communities appeared in China, India, and the Fertile Crescent. Around the Year 4000, 8,000 years ago from today, humans started to use metal for the first time, learning to mix tin and copper and kick-starting what we know as the Bronze Age around the year 5000. The first proto-writing emerged, and the wheel was invented. In South America, the Chinchorro culture started to artificially mummify humans, 2,000 years earlier than in Ancient Egypt. The first high cultures began emerging around the year 7000. The Indus Valley Civilization, Ancient Egypt, the Minoans in Greece, and the Sumerians in Mesopotamia. Stonehenge was built in Britain, and the first dynasty in China began. Ötzi the Ice Man lived around this time. What we consider history now started and things began picking up pace, as the world population rose to over 30,000,000. A number of new high cultures appeared around the world, many writing down their legends. More and more cities were founded. In South America the Olmec culture emerged. Around this time, the legendary siege of Troy is supposed to have happened. Soon after in the eastern Mediterranean in the Fertile Crescent, the bronze age ended in violence. Every Bronze Age culture, except Egypt, was destroyed by mysterious invaders. Writing and progress froze for hundreds of years. Around the Year 9500, what we consider Western culture began. The Greek city-states beat off the persian invasion, and triggered their golden era, ended by Alexander the Great around 9700. 100 years later, Rome destroyed Carthage, and became a dominant force in the world. Caesar was murdered in the year 9956, while the world population had risen to about 300,000,000 people. And it's only now around the year 10,000, that we've reached the point where the Gregorian calendar and our current method of marking human history begins. A mere 2,000 years from now, humans will walk on the moon. If we think about history as we do now, we are underplaying 10,000 years of human progress and development. Including all of it in our calendar makes our past more impressive. It shows how progress became exponential with time, and it incorporates all humans from.. ..all cultures into our calendar. A New Year 0 for our history could re-frame how we think of ourselves. As a building project that started 12,000 years ago when for the first time, our ancestors came together to carve a temple out of bedrock with tools made of stone; not knowing what they would set in motion, where it would lead us as a species. From building the first temple, to ships flying beyond the sky.\", 'The fundamental currency of our universe is energy. It lights our homes, grows our food,\\npowers our computers. We can get it lots of ways: Burning fossil fuels, splitting atoms, or sunlight striking photovoltaics. But there\\'s a downside to everything Fossil fuels are extremely toxic, Nuclear waste is... well, nuclear waste, And, there are not enough batteries to store sunlight for cloudy days yet. And yet the sun seems to have virtually limitless free energy. Is there a way we could build a sun on Earth? Can we bottle a star? [Intro Jingle] The sun shines because of nuclear fusion. In a nutshell, fusion is a thermonuclear process. Meaning that the ingredients have to be incredibly hot. So hot, that the atoms are stripped of their electrons Making a plasma where nuclei and electrons bounce around freely. Since nuclei are all positively charged, They repel each other. In order to overcome this repulsion, The particles have to be going very, very fast In this context, very fast means \"very hot\" Millions of degrees Stars cheat to reach these temperatures. They are so massive, that the pressure in their cores Generates the heat to squeeze the nuclei together Until they merge and fuse Creating heavier nuclei and releasing energy in the process. It is this energy release that scientists hope to harness In a new generation of power plant, The fusion reactor. On earth it\\'s not feasible to use this brute force method to create fusion. So if we wanted to build a reactor that generates energy from fusion, We have to get clever. To date, scientists have invented two ways of making plasmas hot enough to fuse: The first type of reactor uses a magnetic field to Squeeze a plasma in a doughnut shaped chamber Where the reactions take place. These magnetic confinement reactors Such as the I.T.E.R. reactor in France, Use superconducting electromagnets cooled with liquid helium To within a few degrees of absolute zero. Meaning that they host some of the biggest temperature gradients in the known universe. The second type called \"Inertial confinement\" Uses pulses from super-powered lasers To heat the surface of a pellet of fuel Imploding it, briefly making the fuel hot and dense enough to fuse. In fact, one of the of the most powerful lasers in the world Is used for fusion experiments At the National Ignition Facility in the U.S. These experiments and others like them around the world are today, just experiments. Scientists are still developing the technology, And although they can achieve fusion, Right now, it costs more energy to do the experiment Then they produce in fusion. The technology has a long way to go before it\\'s commercially viable, and maybe it never will be. It might just be impossible to make a viable fusion reactor on earth, But if it gets there, it will be so efficient That a single glass of sea water, could be used to produce as much energy as burning a barrel of oil, with no waste to speak of. This is because fusion reactors\\nwould use hydrogen or helium as fuel And sea water is loaded with hydrogen But not just any hydrogen will do. Specific isotopes with extra neutrons called Deuterium and Tritium Are needed to make the right reactions. Deuterium is stable and can be found in abundance in sea water, Though Tritium is a bit trickier. It\\'s radioactive And there may only be 20 kilograms of it in the world Mostly in nuclear warheads Which makes it incredibly expensive. So we made need another fusion buddy for Deuterium instead of Tritium. Helium-3, an isotope of Helium,\\nmight be a great substitute. Unfortunately, it\\'s also incredibly rare on earth. But here, the moon might have the answer. Over billions of years, the solar wind may have built up huge deposits Of Helium-3 on the moon. Instead of making Helium-3, we can mine it. If we could sift the lunar dust for helium, We\\'d have enough fuel to power the entire world for thousands of years. One more argument for establishing a moon base, if you weren\\'t convinced already. Ok, maybe you think building a mini sun Still sound kind of dangerous But they\\'d actually be much safer\\nthan most other types of powerplants A fusion reactor is not like a nuclear plant, Which can melt down catastrophically. If the confinement failed, then the plasma would expand and cool, And the reaction would stop. Put simply, it\\'s not a bomb. The release of radioactive fuel, like Tritium, Could pose a threat to the environment. Tritium could bond with oxygen making radioactive water, Which could be dangerous as it seeps into the environment. Fortunately, there\\'s no more than a few grams in use at a given time, So a leak would be quickly diluted. So we\\'ve just told you that theres nearly unlimited energy to be had At no expense to the environment In something as simple as water. So, whats the catch? Cost. We simply don\\'t know if fusion power will ever be commercially viable. Even if they work, they might be too expensive to ever build. The main drawback, is that it\\'s unproven technology Its a 10 billion dollar gamble And that money might be better\\nspent on other clean energy That\\'s already proven itself. Maybe we should cut out losses Or maybe, when the payoff is unlimited\\nclean energy for everyone, It might be worth the risk.

Let us know in the comments if there are other technologies you want us to explain.', \"What if our universe comes with a self-destruct button to eliminate itself so cleanly and efficiently, that every single physical thing would just stop existing and life would be impossible forever. The ultimate ecological catastrophe - vacuum decay. (Theme music) To explain how our universe could destroy itself, we need to understand two principles: One - energy levels. A core idea in physics is that everything has an energy level. The higher the level,\\nthe more energy is in the system Wood, for example, has a high level. It can be burnt, a process that releases the chemical energy \\nstored in its molecular bonds and turns it into heat. The ash leftover is at a lower energy level than the wood before. Two - stability. Everything in our universe tries to move towards its ground state,\\nin which it's completely stable and has as little energy as possible. For example, a ball on a hill is unstable and has a lot of potential energy. When disturbed,\\nit will roll down into the valey and lose its potential energy\\nin the process The ball is now\\nin its ground state and stable. It will remain like that. Everything in our universe follows these two principles. If something has a lot of energy, it's unstable and wants to get rid of it to become stable and reach its ground state. This is true for every system even in the weird world of quantum mechanics. If our current understanding of physics\\nis correct, then the universe gets its properties from quantum fields. We explained them in detail in another video. For this video, imagine them as the rules of the universe. They tell particles how to behave and interact Like everything in the universe, they want to be\\nin the lowest energy level possible, which is called a vacuum state. This has nothing to do with vacuum in space. It's just called this way because scientists are bad at\\nnaming things We then call the fields reached their vacuum state, except maybe one. It's possible that the Higgs Field is not stable, but metastable, which is a fancy way of saying that it pretends to be stable but really is not. It would be a false vacuum. The Higgs Field is responsible for giving particles their mass, which rules how almost everything in the universe interacts. What would happen if the Higgs Field\\nis a false vacuum? Think of our ball in the valley: the ball is the Higgs Field. The valley might not be the\\nlowest energy state for the Higgs Field. There might an even deeper valley\\nthat it wants to get to. This would mean that the Higgs Field\\nhas a lot of potential energy, waiting to be released. The Higgs Field could be\\nlike a piece of wood but drenched in gasoline, waiting to set the universe on fire. A random spark like quantum tunneling could release the potential energy of the Higgs Fields. This could happen at any time and without warning. If at any point in space, this so-called vacuum decay starts, there is no turning back. As the Higgs Field crashes into the lower energy state, it releases a massive amount of potential energy. This energy pushes the space around it over the barrier, which releases more potential energy. A sphere of the new stable Higgs Field, or true vacuum, grows at the speed of light in all directions. Imagine it like setting a sea of gasoline, the size of the universe, on fire. This sphere is surrounded by a shell of energy that devours everything it comes into contact with. Whatever it touches is eliminated for existence. The bubble will continue to grow forever. deleting the universe on its way. There is no way to be warned, since it's so fast. But there's nothing we can do anyway. Our destruction would be instant, in a fraction of second, Earth would be gone. But it actually gets worse. If the energy level of the Higgs Field changes, it changes all of physics. In the true vacuum of the sphere, the standard model will be overthrown, superseded by different physics that we don't know - how fundamental particles behave, how atoms hold together, how chemicals react. Vacuum decay won't just destroy life, it will destroy chemistry itself, making life as we know it impossible. We simply have no idea what it would be like inside. It might be a shadow of what it is now, or not. We don't know. If vacuum decay happens, the outlook is indeed grim. If you feel slightly worried now, don't be. At this point, false vacuum is speculation based on our current understanding of particle physics, which might be wrong. It's kind of like using a ruler to measure a continent. (playful music) Sure, you can do it, but you might be off by quite a bit at the end. Right now, no-one can say a vacuum decay is a thing that's real or just a scary idea. But even if one or multiple spheres of death have already started expanding, the universe is so big that they might not reach us for billions of years. If they're far enough away, they might not ever be able to reach us because of the expansion of the universe. The speed of light is not that fast on the scale of the universe. So, while vacuum decay is fascinatingly scary, right now, there are other things we should be more afraid of. In contrast to vacuum decay, we have the power to prepare for most of them.

We tried to destroy the universe at least once every few months. So let us know in the comments, if you have doomsday scenarios you would like us to cover. Subtitles by the Amara.org community\", \"magine you were alive back in the 1980's, and were told that computers would soon take over everything: from shopping, to dating, and the stock market, that billions of people would be connected via a kind of web, that you would own a handheld device, orders of magnitudes more powerful than supercomputers. It would seem absurd, but then, all of it happened. Science fiction became our reality, and we don't even think about it. We're at a similar point today with genetic engineering. So, let's talk about it. Where it came from, what we're doing right now, and about a recent breakthrough, that will change how we live and what we perceive as normal, forever. Humans have been engineering life for thousands of years. Through selective breeding, we strengthened useful traits in plants and animals. We became very good at this, but never fully understood how it worked. Until we discovered the code of life, Deoxyribonucleic Acid—DNA. A complex molecule that guides the growth, development, function, and reproduction of everything alive. Information is encoded in the structure of the molecule. Four nucleotides are paired and make up a code that carries instructions. Change the instructions and you change the being carrying it. As soon as DNA was discovered, people tried to tinker with it. In the 1960's, scientist bombarded plants with radiation to cause random mutations in the genetic code. The idea was to get a useful plant variation by pure chance. Sometimes it actually worked too. In the 70's, scientists inserted DNA\\nsnippets into bacteria, plants, and animals to study and modify them for\\nresearch, medicine, agriculture, and for fun. The earliest genetically modified animal\\nwas born in 1974, making mice a standard tool for research, saving millions of lives. In the 80's, we got commercial. The first patent was given for a microbe engineered to absorb oil. Today we produce many chemicals by means of engineered life, like life-saving clotting factors, growth hormones, and insulin. All things we had to harvest from the organs of animals before that. The first food modified in the lab went on sale in 1994: the Flavr Savr tomato, a tomato given a much longer shelf life where an extra gene that suppresses the build-up of a rotting enzyme. But GM food and the controversy surrounding them deserve a video of their own. In the 1990's, there was also a brief\\nforay into human engineering. To treat maternal infertility, babies were made that carried genetic information from 3 humans. Making them the first humans ever to have 3 genetic parents. Today there are super muscled pigs, fast-growing salmon, featherless chicken, and see-through frogs. On the fun side, we made things glow in the dark. Fluorescent zebrafish are available for\\nas little as ten dollars. All of this is already very impressive, but until recently gene editing was extremely expensive,\\ncomplicated, and took a long time to do. This has now changed with a revolutionary new technology now entering the stage—CRISPR. Overnight, the costs of engineering have shrunk by 99 %. Instead of a year, it takes a few weeks to conduct experiments, and basically everybody with a lab can do it. It's hard to get across how big a technical revolution CRISPR is. It literally has the potential to change humanity forever. Why did this sudden revolution happen and how does it work? Bacteria and viruses have been fighting\\nsince the dawn of life. So-called bacteriophages or phages hunt bacteria. In the ocean, phages kill 40 % of them every single day. Phages do this by inserting their own genetic code into the bacteria and taking them over to use them as factories. The bacteria tried to resist but failed most the time because their protection tools are too weak, But sometimes bacteria survive an attack. Only if they do so can they activate their most effective antivirus system: they save a part of the virus DNA in their own genetic code in a DNA archive called CRISPR. Here it's stored safely until it's needed. When the virus attacks again, the bacterium quickly makes an RNA copy from the DNA archive and arms a secret weapon—a protein called CAS9. The protein now scans the bacterium's\\ninsides for signs of the virus invader by comparing every bit of DNA it finds to the sample from the archive. When it finds a 100-percent perfect match, it's activated and cuts out the virus\\nDNA, making it useless, protecting the bacterium against the attack. What's special is that CAS9 is very\\nprecise, almost like a DNA surgeon. The revolution began when scientists figured out that the CRISPR system is programmable. You can just give it a copy of DNA you want to modify and put the system into a living cell. If the old techniques of genetic manipulation were like a map, CRISPR is like a GPS system. Aside from being precise, cheap, and easy, CRISPR offers the ability to edit live cells, to switch genes on and off, and target and study particular DNA sequences. It also works for every type of cell: microorganisms, plants, animals, or humans. But despite the revolution CRISPR is for science, it's still just a first generation tool. More precise tools are already being created and used as we speak. In 2015, scientists use CRISPR to cut the HIV virus out of living cells from patients in the lab, proving that it was possible. Only about a year later, they carried out a larger scale project with rats that had the HIV virus in basically all of their body cells. By simply injecting CRISPR into the rats tails, they were able to remove more than 50 %\\nof the virus from cells all over the body. In a few decades, a CRISPR therapy\\nmight cure HIV and other retroviruses, viruses that hide inside human DNA like\\nHerpes could be eradicated this way. CRISPR could also defeat one of our worst enemies—cancer. Cancer occurs when cells refuse to die and keep multiplying while concealing themselves from the immune system. CRISPR gives us the means to edit your immune cells and make them better cancer hunters. Getting rid of cancer might eventually mean getting just a couple of injections of a\\nfew thousand of your own cells that have been engineered in the lab to heal you for good. The first clinical trial for a CRISPR cancer treatment on human patients was approved in early 2016 in the\\nUS. Not even a month later, Chinese scientists announced that they would treat lung cancer patients with immune cells modified with CRISPR in August 2016. Things are picking up pace quickly. And then there are genetic diseases. There are thousands of them and they range from mildly annoying to deadly or entail decades of suffering. With a powerful tool like CRISPR, we may be able to end this. Over 3,000 genetic diseases are caused by a single incorrect letter in your DNA. We are already building a modified\\nversion of CAS9 that is made to change just a single letter, fixing the disease in the cell. In a decade or two, we could possibly cure thousands of diseases forever. But all of these medical applications have one thing in common: they are limited to the individual and die with them, except if you use them on reproductive cells or very early embryos. But CRISPR can and probably will be used for much more: the creation of modified humans—designer babies—and will mean gradual, but irreversible changes to the human gene pool. The means to edit the genome of a human embryo already exists. Though the technology is still in its early stages, but it has already been attempted twice. In 2015 and 2016, Chinese scientists experimented with human embryos and were partially successful on their second attempt. They showed the enormous challenges we still face in gene editing embryos, but also that scientists are\\nworking on solving them. This is like the computer in the 70's. There will be better computers. Regardless of your personal take on\\ngenetic engineering, it will affect you. Modified humans could alter the genome of our entire species, because their engineered traits will be passed on to their children and could spread over generations, slowly modifying the whole gene pool of humanity. It will start slowly. The first designer babies will not be overly designed. It's most likely that they will be created to eliminate a deadly genetic disease running in a family. As the technology progresses and gets\\nmore refined, more and more people may argue that not using genetic modification is unethical, because it condemns children to preventable suffering and death and denies them the cure. But as soon as the first engineered kid is born, a door is opened that can't be closed anymore. Early on, vanity traits will mostly be left alone. But as genetic modification becomes more accepted and our knowledge of our genetic code enhances, the temptation will grow. If you make your offspring immune to Alzheimer, why not also give them an enhanced metabolism? Why not throw in perfect eyesight? How about height or muscular structure? Full hair? How about giving your child the gift of\\nextraordinary intelligence? Huge changes are made as a result of the personal decisions of millions of individuals that accumulate. This is a slippery slope. Modified humans could become the new standard. But as engineering becomes more\\nnormal and our knowledge improves, we could solve the single biggest mortality risk factor: aging. Two-thirds of the 150,000 people who died today will die of age-related causes. Currently we think aging is caused by the accumulation of damage to our cells, like DNA breaks and the systems responsible for fixing those wearing off over time. But there are also genes that directly affect aging. A combination of genetic engineering and other therapy could stop or slow down aging, maybe even reverse it. We know from nature that there are animals immune to aging. Maybe we could even borrow a few genes for ourselves. Some scientists even think biological aging could be something that eventually just stops being a thing. We would still die at some point, but instead of doing so in hospitals at age 90, we might be able to spend a few thousand years with our loved ones. Research into this is in its infancy, and many scientists are rightly skeptical about the end of aging. The challenges are enormous and maybe it is unachievable, but it is conceivable the people alive today might be the first to profit from effective anti aging therapy. All we might need is for someone to convince a smart billionaire to make it their next problem to solve. On a bigger scale, we certainly could solve many problems by having a modified population. Engineered humans might be better equipped to cope with high-energy food, eliminating many diseases of civilization like obesity. In possession of a modified immune system, with a library of potential threats, we might become immune to most diseases that haunt us today. Even further into the future, we could engineer humans to be equipped for extended space travel and to cope with different conditions on another planets, which would be extremely helpful in\\nkeeping us alive in our hostile universe. Still, a few major challenges await us: some technological, some ethical. Many of you watching will feel uncomfortable and fear that we will create a world in which we will reject non-perfect humans and pre-select features and qualities based on our idea of what's healthy. The thing is we are already living in\\nthis world. Tests for dozens of genetic diseases or complications have become standard for pregnant women in much of the world. Often the mere suspicion of a genetic defect can lead to the end of a pregnancy. Take Down syndrome for example, one of the most common genetic defects. In Europe, about 92 % of all pregnancies where it's detected are terminated. The decision to terminate pregnancy is incredibly personal, but it's important to acknowledge the reality that we are pre-selecting humans based on medical conditions. There is also no use in pretending this will change, so we have to act carefully and respectfully as we advance the technology and can make more and more\\nselections. But none of this will happen soon. As powerful as CRISPR is—and it is, it's not infallible yet. Wrong edits still happen as well as unknown errors that can occur anywhere in the DNA and might go unnoticed. The gene edit might achieve the desired result—disabling a disease, but also might accidentally trigger unwanted changes. We just don't know enough yet about the\\ncomplex interplay of our genes to avoid unpredictable consequences. Working on accuracy and monitoring methods is a major concern as the first human trials begin. And since we've discussed a possible positive future, there are darker visions too. Imagine what a state like North Korea\\ncould do if they embraced genetic engineering. Could a state cement its rule forever by forcing gene editing on their subjects? What would stop a totalitarian regime from engineering an army of modified super soldiers? It is doable in theory. Scenarios like this one are far, far off into the future, if they ever become possible at all. But the basic proof of concept for genetic engineering like this already exists today. The technology really is that powerful. While this might be a tempting reason to ban genetic editing and related research, that would certainly be a mistake. Banning human genetic engineering would only lead to the science wandering off to a place with jurisdiction and rules\\nthat we are uncomfortable with. Only by participating can we make sure that further research is guided by caution, reason, oversight, and transparency. Do you feel uncomfortable now? Most of us have something wrong with them. In the future that lies ahead of us, would we have been allowed to exist? The technology is certainly a bit scary, but we have a lot to gain, and genetic engineering might just be a step in the natural evolution of intelligent species in the universe. We might end disease. We could extend our life expectancy by centuries and travel to the stars. There's no need to think small when it comes to this topic. Whatever your opinion on genetic engineering, the future is approaching no matter what. What has been insane science fiction is about to become our new reality, a reality full of opportunities and challenges.

Never before have we humans lived in a world as sophisticated and engineered to our needs as today. Giving us the luxury to forget about ourselves and not worry about survival. Food, shelter, security – all of this is, more or less, taken for granted. But we're a special few; for more than 99.99% of human history, life was completely different. And there's no such thing as just one human history. Our story begins 6 million years ago, when the tribe of hominini split and our relationship with the apes ended. 2.8 million years ago, the genus of homo, the first humans, emerged. We like to think about ourselves as the only humans, but this is far from the truth. When we, homo sapiens sapiens, came into existence 200,000 years ago, there were at least six other human species around. Cousins of comparable intelligence and ability, which must have been incredibly scary, kind of like living with aliens. Some of them were very successful. Homo erectus, for example, survived for 2 million years. Ten times longer than modern humans have existed. The last of the other humans disappeared around 10,000 years ago. We don't know what caused them to die out. Modern humans have at least a few percent of neanderthal and other human DNA, so there was some mixing, but certainly not enough to be a merger between species. So we don't know if our cousins went away because they lost the battle over resources, or because of a series of minor genocides. Either way, only we remain. Back to the beginnings of humanity. 2.8 million years ago, early humans used tools, but did not make a lot of progress for nearly 2 million years. Until they learned to control fire. Fire meant cooking, which made food more nutritious, which contributed to the development of our brain. It also produced light and warmth, which made days longer and winters less gruesome. On top of that, it not only scared predators away, it could also be used for hunting. A torched wood or grassland provided small animals, nuts and tubers that were pre-roasted. From 300,000 years ago, most of the different human species lived in small hunter-gatherer societies. They had fire, wood and stone tools, planned for the future, buried their dead, and had cultures of their own. But most importantly, they spoke to each other. Probably in a kind of proto-language, less complex than ours. If we had a time machine, how far would we be able to go back, steal a few babies and raise them today without anyone noticing that they're a bit different? There is much debate. Anatomically, modern humans emerged 200,000 years ago, but probably 70,000 years is as far as we could travel back and still snatch a behaviourally modern human. Before that, the babies would probably lack a few crucial gene mutations Necessary to build a brain with modern language and abstract thinking abilities. At some point, around 50,000 years ago, there was an explosion in innovation. Tools and weapons became more sophisticated and culture became more complex, because at this point, humans had a multi-purpose brain, and a more advanced language to communicate information with each other effectively, and down to the last detail. This allowed much closer cooperation, and is what really makes us different from any other creature on Earth. Not our comparatively weak bodies and inferior senses, but the ability to cooperate flexibly in large groups, unlike, for example, rigid beehives or intimate, but tiny wolf packs. As our brain evolved, we became able to do something, life had been unable to do up to this point. One – expand knowledge quickly. Two – preserve the knowledge gained over generations. Three – build on past knowledge, to gain even deeper insight. This seems daft, but until then, information had to be passed on from generation to generation, mostly through genetics, which is not efficient. Still, for the next 40,000 years, human life remained more or less the same. There was little to build upon. Our ancestors were only one animal among many. Building a skyscraper without knowing what a house is… is hard. But while it is easy to be arrogant in our attitude to our ancestors, this would be ignorant. Humans 50,000 years ago were survival specialists. They had a detailed mental map of their territory, their senses were fine-tuned to the environment, they knew and memorized a great amount of information about plants and animals. They could make complicated tools that required years of careful training and very fine motor skills Their bodies compared to our athletes today just because of their daily routines, and they lived a rich social life within their tribe Survival required so many skills that the average brain volume of early modern humans might even have been bigger than it is today As a group we know more today, but as individuals our ancestors were superior to us But then around 12,000 years ago, in multiple locations, humans developed agriculture. Everything changed very quickly. Before, survival as a hunter and forager required superb physical and mental abilities in all fields from everybody With the rise of the agricultural age, individuals could increasingly rely on the skills of others for survival. This meant that some of them could specialize. Maybe they worked on better tools, maybe they took time to breed more resistant crops or better livestock, Maybe they started inventing things. As farming got more and more efficient, what we call civilization began Agriculture gave us a reliable and predictable food source, which allowed humans to hoard food on a large scale for the first time, which is much easier to do with grains than meat, The food stock required protection, which led to communities living together in tighter spaces First, early defense structures were built, the need for organization grew The more organized we got, the faster things became efficient Villages became cities, cities became kingdoms, kingdoms became empires Connections between humans exploded which led to opportunities to exchange knowledge Progress became exponential About 500 years ago the Scientific Revolution began Mathematics, Physics, Astronomy, Biology, and Chemistry transformed everything we thought we knew The Industrial Revolution followed soon after laying the foundation for the modern world As our overall efficiency grew exponentially, more people could spend their lifetime contributing to the progress of humanity Revolutions kept happening. The invention of the computer, its evolution into a medium we all use on a daily basis, and the rise of the Internet shaped our world It's hard to grasp how fast all of that happened It's been about 125,000 generations since the emergence of the first human species About 7,500 generations since the physiologically modern humans saw the light of day 500 generations ago, what we call civilization began 20 generations ago, we learned how to do science And the Internet became available to most people only one generation ago Today we live in the most prosperous age humanity has ever experienced We have transformed this planet, from the composition of its atmosphere to large-scale changes in its landscape and also in terms of the other animals in existence. We light up the night with artificial stars and put people in a metal box in the sky Some have even walked on our Moon We put robots on other planets We've looked deep into the past of the universe with mechanical eyes Our knowledge and our way of acquiring and storing more of it has exploded The average high school student today knows more about the universe than a scholar a few centuries ago Humans dominate this planet, even if our rule is very fragile We are still not that different from our ancestors 70,000 years ago But your lifestyle has existed for less than 0.001% of human history From here on, there's no saying what the future holds for us We're building a skyscraper, but we're not sure if it's standing on a solid foundation or if we're building it on quicksand Let's leave it with that for now The next time you miss your train, your burger is not hot enough, or someone cuts in line Remember how special this made-up human world is Maybe it's not worth being upset about all those little things.

Turns out there are. Even with science fiction technology, we are trapped in our pocket of the universe. How can that be? And how far can we go? We live in a quiet arm of the Milky Way a spiral galaxy of average size about one hundred thousand light years across, consisting of billions of stars, gas clouds, dark matter, black holes, neutron stars, and planets, with a supermassive black hole in the galactic centre. From afar, our galaxy seems dense, but in reality it consists mostly of empty space With our current technology, sending a human to the closest star will take thousands of years So our galaxy is... pretty big. The Milky Way is not alone, though. Along with the Andromeda galaxy and more than fifty dwarf galaxies, it\\'s part of the \"local group\" a region of space about ten million light years in diameter It is one of hundreds of galaxy groups in the Laniakea Supercluster. Which itself is only one of millions of superclusters that make up the observable universe. Now, let\\'s assume for a moment that we have a glorious future. Humanity becomes a type 3 civilization, does not get wiped out by aliens, and develops interstellar travel based on our current understanding of physics. In this best case scenario, how far could we possibly go? Well, the Local Group. It is the biggest structure that humanity will ever be a part of. While it is certainly huge, the Local Group accounts for only 0.00000000001% of the observable universe. Let this number sink in for a moment. We are limited to a hundred billionth of a percent of the observable universe. The simple fact that there is actually a limit for us, and that there is so much universe that we will never be able to touch is kind of frightening. Why can\\'t we go further? Well, it all has to do with the nature of nothing. Nothing, or empty space, isn\\'t empty but has energy intrinsic to itself, so-called quantum fluctuations. On the smallest scale, there is constant action. Particles and anti-particles appearing and annihilating themselves. You can imagine this quantum vacuum as a bubbling pot with denser and less dense regions. Now, let\\'s go back 13.8 billions of years, when the fabric of space consisted of nothing at all. Right after the Big Bang, in a event known as cosmic inflation, the observable universe expanded from the size of a marble to trillions of kilometres in fractions of a second. This sudden stretching of the universe was so fast and extreme that all of those quantum fluctuations were stretched as well, and subatomic distances became galactic distances. With dense, and less dense regions. After inflation, gravity began to pull everything back together. At the larger scale, the expansion was too quick and powerful to overcome, but at smaller scales gravity emerged victorious. So, over time, the denser regions or pockets of the universe... grew into groups of galaxies like the one we live in today. Only stuff inside our pocket, the Local Group, is bound to us gravitationally. But wait, what\\'s the problem then? Why can\\'t we travel from our pocket to the next one? Here, dark energy makes everything complicated. About six billion years ago, dark energy took over. It\\'s basically an invisible force or effect that causes and speeds up the expansion of the universe. We don\\'t know why, or what dark energy is. But we can observe its effect clearly. In the early universe there were larger cold spots around the Local Group... that grew into large clusters with thousands of galaxies. We are surrounded by a lot of stuff. But none of those structures and galaxies outside of the Local Group are gravitationally bound to us. So the more the universe expands, the larger the distance between us and other gravitational pockets becomes. Over time, dark energy will push the rest of the universe away from us, causing all the other clusters, galaxies and groups to eventually become unreachable. The next galaxy group is already millions of light years away. But all of them are moving away from us at speeds we can\\'t ever hope to match. We could leave the Local Group and fly through intergalactic space into the darkness, but we would never arrive anywhere. While we will become more and more stranded, the Local Group will become more tightly bound and merge together to form one giant elliptical galaxy with the unoriginal name: Milkdromeda... In a few billion years. But it becomes even more depressing. At some point, the galaxies outside the Local Group will be so far away... that they will be too faint to detect ... and the few photons that do make it to us will be shifted to such long wavelengths that they will be undetectable. Once this happens, no information outside the Local Group will be able to reach us. The universe will recede from view. It will appear to be dark and empty in all directions, forever. A being born in the far future in Milkdromeda will think there is nothing but its own galaxy in the entire universe! When they look far into empty space, they will only see more emptiness and darkness. They won\\'t be able to see cosmic background radiation, and they won\\'t be able to learn about the Big Bang. They will have no way of knowing what we know today. The nature of the expanding universe, when it began, and how it will end. They will think the universe is static and eternal. Milkdromeda will be an island in the darkness, slowly getting darker and darker. Still, with its trillion stars, the Local Group is certainly large enough for humanity. After all, we still haven\\'t figured out how to leave our Solar System... and we have billions of years to explore our galaxy. We have the incredible luck to exist at the perfect moment in time, to see not only our future, but also our most distant past. As isolated and remote as the Local Group is, we can perceive the entire universe, grand and spectacular, as it is right now. Thanks so much for the help of the video to Ethan Seagal.

It\\'s awesome that you watched this far, so we\\'ve made a playlist for you about more universe stuff.', 'Over 40 years ago,\\nUS President Richard Nixon declared drug abuse\\npublic enemy number one, starting an unprecedented global campaign,\\nthe War on Drugs. Today, the numbers are in. The War on Drugs is a huge failure,\\nwith devastating unintended consequences. It led to mass incarceration in the US; to corruption, political destabilization,\\nand violence in Latin America, Asia, and Africa; to systemic human rights\\nabuses across the world. It negatively affected the\\nlives of millions of people. All of this while we waste\\nbillions of dollars every year only to create and fuel\\npowerful drug cartels while the goal of the War on Drugs\\nseems less achievable than ever: a world without drugs. How could this happen? The core strategy of the War on Drugs is\\n“no drugs, no problems”. So almost all of the efforts\\nin the last few decades have been focused on eradicating\\nthe supply of drugs and incarcerating drug traffickers. But this ignores the most\\nfundamental of market forces, supply and demand. If you reduce the supply of anything\\nwithout reducing the demand first, its price goes up. This might lower sales for many products,\\nbut not for drugs. The drugs market is not price-sensitive. Drugs will be consumed\\nno matter what they cost. So the effect is to encourage\\nproduction of more drugs and recruitment of more traffickers,\\nwhich increases availability. This is also known as the balloon effect:\\neven if drug production or a major supply route is destroyed, the\\nsupply for the end user is not reduced. A perfect example of this is crystal meth. The US Government tried\\nto stop its production by strictly regulating the sale of\\nchemicals used to manufacture the drug. This forced big meth producers\\nout of business, but the unintended consequences were that\\nthousands of small-scale operations started all over the country, mostly\\nin small towns and rural communities, using chemicals that weren’t regulated. In response to this, some US states wanted\\nto reduce the supply of home-grown meth by regulating even more chemicals, which reduced small-scale\\nmeth production drastically. But the supply of\\nmeth still stayed the same. Mexican drug cartels immediately took over\\nand opened big production operations. Their meth was even better\\nthan it was before, and they had lots of\\nexperience in smuggling. So all these efforts made meth\\nproduction more professional, the drug more potent, while\\nsupply wasn’t reduced at all. You can’t win this war on the supply side. Not only are drugs widely available,\\ndemand unbroken, and some drugs purer than in the past,\\nwith a budget of around $30 billion, the US Drug Enforcement Agency has\\nan efficiency rate of less than 1% when it comes to stopping\\nthe flow of drugs into the US and inside the US. For many minors around the world, it’s\\nas easy to get illegal drugs as alcohol. But it doesn’t stop here. Prohibition may prevent a certain\\namount of people from taking drugs, but in the process it causes huge\\ndamage to society as a whole. Many of the problems we\\nassociate with drug use are actually caused by\\nthe war against them. For example, prohibition\\nmakes drugs stronger. The more potent drugs you can store\\nin as little space as possible, the more profit you’ll make. It was the same during\\nalcohol prohibition, which led to an increased consumption\\nof strong liquor over beer. The prohibition of drugs also led to more\\nviolence and murders around the world. Gangs and cartels have no access to\\nthe legal system to settle disputes, so they use violence. This led to an ever-increasing\\nspiral of brutality. According to some estimates,\\nthe homicide rate in the US is 25–75% higher because of\\nthe War on Drugs. And in Mexico, the country\\non the frontline, an estimated 164,000 have been\\nmurdered between 2007 and 2014, more people than in the war zones\\nof Afghanistan and Iraq in the same period, combined. But where the War on Drugs might do\\nthe most damage to society is the incarceration of\\nnon-violent drug offenders. For example, the United States, one of the driving forces\\nof the War on Drugs, has 5% of the world’s total population,\\nbut 25% of the world’s prison population, largely due to the harsh\\npunishments and mandatory minimums. Minorities suffer\\nbecause of this especially. African Americans make up\\n40% of all US prison inmates. And while white kids are\\nmore likely to abuse drugs, black kids are 10 times more likely\\nto get arrested for drug offenses. OK, but is there actually\\nsomething different we could do? Is there a way out of this mess? In the 1980s, Switzerland experienced a public health crisis\\nrelated to heroin use. HIV rates skyrocketed and\\nstreet crime became a problem. Swiss authorities tried a new strategy:\\nharm reduction. They opened free\\nheroin maintenance centers, where addicts would\\nbe treated and stabilized. Here, people would be given\\nfree heroin of high quality, they would get clean needles\\nand have access to safe injection rooms, showers, beds, and medical supervision. Social workers help them find housing and\\ndeal with other problems in their lives. The results were a sharp drop in\\ndrug-related crime and two thirds of the people in the\\ncenters got regular jobs, because now they could\\nfocus on getting better insetad of financing their addiction. Today, over 70% of all heroin addicts\\nin Switzerland receive treatment. HIV infections have dropped drastically. Deaths from heroin overdoses\\nhave dropped by 50%. And drug-related street sex work and crime\\nhas been reduced enormously. So there are methods that are\\nnot only way cheaper, but also actually work, instead of\\ncreating more problems. Drug prohibition led to a system\\nthat bulldozes human rights, costs vasts sums of money, and\\ncreates a lot of human misery, all in pursuit of an unobtainable goal. After 40 years of fighting, it’s time\\nto finally end the War on Drugs and move on to something better. This video was supported by\\nthe Open Society Foundations and by viewer donations on Patreon.

That's also one of our best bets to find alien life, and might be the last home of humanity before the universe becomes uninhabitable. So, what do we know about them, and why are they our last hope? At least 70% of stars in the universe are red dwarfs. They are the tiniest stars out there, with only about 7 to 50% of the mass of our sun. Not that much bigger than our planet Jupiter, which is still huge though. They are also very dim. It is impossible to see them with the naked eye. You have never seen one in the night sky. Even with all our technology, we can only clearly observe red dwarfs in our neighborhood. Approximately 20 of the 30 stars close to earth are red dwarfs. Like all stars, red dwarfs fuse hydrogen into helium. But while more massive stars accumulate all the fused helium in their cores, red dwarfs stay convective, meaning that the  helium and hydrogen constantly mix. So they use up their fuel incredibly slowly, before they are extinguished. Red dwarfs burn so slowly, that their average lifespan is between 1 and 10 trillion years by comparison, the Sun will survive for another 5 billion years Because the universe is only 13.75 billion years old not a single red dwarf has reached the later development stages Every single one of the trillions that exist is still a baby. Speaking of babies, the smallest star in the entire universe is also a red dwarf because small red dwarfs\\nare right on the verge of being a star at all. Just a tiny bit less hydrogen and\\nthey are mere brown dwarfs: failed stars that cannot sustain a fusion reaction\\nfor long. So what about aliens or a new home for Humanity? Since our Sun will die one day, we'll eventually need to look for a new home and where there are habitable\\nplanets, there might also be aliens. The Kepler space observatory found that at\\nleast half of all red dwarfs host rock planets between half and four times the\\nmass of our Earth. Many of them are in the habitable zone -- the area around a star where water can be liquid -- but since red dwarfs burn at relatively\\ncold temperatures, a planet would need to be really close to be hospitable,\\nprobably as close as Mercury to our Sun or even closer, which brings with it all\\nkinds of problems. For example, a planet this close to a star would probably be\\ntidaly locked, meaning the same side would always face it. This side would be\\nincredibly hot while the shadow side would be frozen, which makes it hard for\\nlife to develop. Although a planet with a big enough ocean might be able to distribute the star's energy and create some kind of stability. All the gravitation forces of a Red Dwarf could squeeze the planet and heat it up so much that it might loose all its water over time. These planets could end up like Venus, a hot burning hell. Another problem is that, many Red Dwarfs vary in their energy output They could be covered in star spots that can dim their emitted light by up to 40% for months Wich would cause oceans on planets to freeze over. At other times, they can emit powerful solar flares; sudden outbursts of energy incredibly powerful. These Red Dwarfs could double their brightness in minutes Wich could strip away sizable portions of a planet's atmosphere and burn it, rendering its On the other hand, their extremely long life span is a big plus. A Red Dwarf with just moderate levels of activity, could be an amazing place for a planet that hosts life. Life on Earth has existed for about 4 Billion years And, we have about a Billion years left before the sun becomes so hot, that complex life on Earth will become impossible. We will either die out or leave Earth and look for a new home. We could build a civilization for potentially trillions of years, around a Red Dwarf with the right conditions. About 5% of the Red Dwarf in the Milky Way, may host habitable, roughly Earth sized planets. That would be more than 4 Billion in total. But, life may not even need a planet like Earth. Candidates for life around a Red Dwarf may be the moons of Gas Giants, also called Super Earths Really massive rocky planets. All alone, there are an estimated 60 Billion potentially habitable planets around Red Dwarfs. And, that's in the Milky Way alone. So, Red Dwarfs might become really important for our survival in the future But, everything has to die at some point, even Red Dwarfs. When in Trillions of years, the life of the last Red Dwarf is about to end, it will not be a very spectacular event. As its hydrogen runs out, it shrinks, becoming a Blue Dwarf, burning out completely. After its fuel is spent, it's transformed into a White Dwarf, an object about as small as Earth Packed very densely and made of degenerate gasses, mostly of Helium-4 nuclei. Having no more source of energy, it will cool extremely slowly over trillions of years. Until it becomes its final form: A cold Black Dwarf. White and Black Dwarfs are so fascinating, that they deserve their own video. Anyway.. It's going to be a long time before the last in the Universe vanish It's kind of uplifting to know that, if humanity succeeds in venturing into Space We have plenty of time, before the Universe turns out the lights. Our videos are made thanks to your support on Patreon.com, if you want to help us make more of them We really appreciate your support ;)\", 'Black holes are one of the strangest things in existence. They don\\'t seem to make any sense at all. Where do they come from... ...and what happens if you fall into one? Stars are incredibly massive collections of mostly hydrogen atoms that collapsed from enormous gas cloud under their own gravity. In their core, nuclear fusion crushes hydrogen atoms into helium releasing a tremendous amount of energy This energy, in the form of radiation, pushes against gravity, maintaining a delicate balance between the two forces. As long as there is fusion in the core, a star remains stable enough. But for stars with way more mass then our own sun the heat and pressure at the core allow them to fuse heavier elements until they reach iron. Unlike all the elements that went before, the fusion process that creates iron doesn\\'t generate any energy. Iron builds up at the center of the star until it reaches a critical amount and the balance between radiation and gravity is suddenly broken. The core collapses. Within a fraction of a second, the star implodes. Moving at about the quarter of the speed of light, feeding even more mass into the core. It\\'s at this very moment that all the heavier elements in the universe are created, as the star dies, in a super nova explosion. This produces either a neutron star, or if the star is massive enough, the entire mass of the core collapses into a black hole. If you looked at a black hole, what you\\'d really be seeing is the event horizon. Anything that crosses the event horizon needs to be travelling faster than the speed of light to escape. In other words, its impossible. So we just see a black sphere reflecting nothing. But if the event horizon is the black part, what is the \"hole\" part of the black hole? The singularity. We\\'re not sure what it is exactly. A singularity may be indefinitely dense, meaning all its mass is concentrated into a single point in space, with no surface or volume, or something completely different. Right now, we just don\\'t know. its like a \"dividing by zero\"error. By the way, black holes do not suck things up like a vacuum cleaner, If we were to swap the sun for an equally massive black hole, nothing much would change for earth, except that we would freeze to death, of course. what would happen to you if you fell into a black hole? The experience of time is different around black holes, from the outside, you seem to slow down as you approach the event horizon, so time passes slower for you. at some point, you would appear to freeze in time, slowly turn red, and disapear. While from your perspective, you can watch the rest of the universe in fast forward, kind of like seeing into the future. Right now, we don\\'t know what happens next, but we think it could be one of two things: One, you die a quick death. A black hole curves space so much, that once you cross the event horizon, there is only one possible direction. you can take this - literally - inside the event horizon, you can only go in one direction. Its like being in a really tight alley that closes behind you after each step. The mass of a black hole is so concentrated, at some point even tiny distances of a few centimeters, would means that gravity acts with millions of times more force on different parts of your body. Your cells get torn apart, as your body stretches more and more, until you are a hot stream of plasma, one atom wide. Two, you die a very quick death. Very soon after you cross the event horizon, you would hit a firewall and be terminated in an instant. Neither of these options are particularly pleasant. How soon you would die depends on the mass of the black hole. A smaller black hole would kill you before you even enter its event horizon, while you probably could travel inside a super size massive black hole for quite a while. As a rule of thumb, the further away from the singularity you are, the longer you live. Black holes come in different sizes. There are stellar mass black holes, with a few times the mass of sun, and the diameter of an asteroid. And then there are the super massive black holes, which are found at the heart of every galaxy, and have been feeding for billions of years. Currently, the largest super massive black hole known, is S5 0014+81. 40 billion times the mass of our sun. It is 236.7 billion kilometers in diameter, which is 47 times the distance from the sun to Pluto. As powerful as black holes are, they will eventually evaporate through a process called Hawking radiation. To understand how this works, we have to look at empty space. Empty space is not really empty, but filled with virtual particles popping into existence and annihilating each other again. When this happens right on the edge of a black hole, one of the virtual particles will be drawn into the black hole, and the other will escape and become a real particle. So the black hole is losing energy. This happens incredibly slowly at first, and gets faster as the black hole becomes smaller. When it arrives at the mass of a large asteroid, its radiating at room temperature. When it has the mass of a mountain, it radiates with about the heat of our sun. and in the last second of its life, the black hole radiates away with the energy of billions of nuclear bombs in a huge explosion. But this process is incredibly slow, The biggest black holes we know, might take up a googol year to evaporate. This is so long that when the last black hole radiates away, nobody will be around to witness it. The universe will have become uninhabitable, long before then. This is not the end of our story, there are loads more interesting ideas about black holes, we\\'ll explore them in part 2.', \"Quantum Computers Explained – Limits of Human Technology For most of our history, human technology consisted of our brains, fire, and sharp sticks. While fire and sharp sticks became power plants and nuclear weapons, the biggest upgrade has happened to our brains. Since the 1960's, the power of our brain machines has kept growing exponentially, allowing computers to get smaller and more powerful at the same time. But this process is about to meet its physical limits. Computer parts are approaching the size of an atom. To understand why this is a problem, we have to clear up some basics. In a Nutshell - By Kurzgesagt A computer is made up of very simple components doing very simple things. Representing data, the means of processing it, and control mechanisms. Computer chips contain modules, which contain logic gates, which contain transistors. A transistor is the simplest form of a data processor in computers, basically a switch that can either block, or open the way for information coming through. This information is made up of bits which can be set to either 0 or 1. Combinations of several bits are used to represent more complex information. Transistors are combined to create logic gates which still do very simple stuff. For example, an AND Gate sends an output of 1 if all of its inputs are 1, and a output of 0 otherwise. Combinations of logic gates finally form meaningful modules, say, for adding two numbers. Once you can add, you can also multiply, and once you can multiply, you can basically do anything. Since all basic operations are literally simpler than first grade math, you can imagine a computer as a group of 7-year-olds answering really basic math questions. A large enough bunch of them could compute anything from astrophysics to Zelda. However, with parts getting tinier and tinier, quantum physics are making things tricky. In a nutshell, a transistor is just an electric switch. Electricity is electrons moving from one place to another. So, a switch is a passage that can block electrons from moving in one direction. Today, a typical scale for transistors is 14 nanometers, which is about 8 times less than the HIV virus' diameter, and 500 times smaller than a red blood cell. As transistors are shrinking to the size of only a few atoms, electrons may just transfer themselves to the other side of a blocked passage via a process called Quantum Tunneling. In the quantum realm, physics works quite differently from the predictable ways we're used to, and traditional computers just stop making sense. We are approaching a real physical barrier for our technological progress. To solve this problem, scientists are trying to use these unusual quantum properties to their advantage by building quantum computers. In normal computers, bits are the smallest unit of information. Quantum computers use qubits which can also be set to one of two values. A qubit can be any two level quantum system, such as a spin and a magnetic field, or a single photon. 0 and 1 are this system's possible states, like the photons horizontal or vertical polarization. In the quantum world, the qubit doesn't have to be just one of those, it can be in any proportions of both states at once. This is called superposition. But as soon as you test its value, say, by sending the photon through a filter, it has to decide to be either vertically or horizontally polarized. So as long as it's unobserved, the qubit is in a superposition of probabilities for 0 and 1, and you can't predit which it'll be. But the instant you measure it, it collapses into one of the definite states. Superposition is a game changer. Four classical bits can be in one of two to the power of four different configurations at a time. That's 16 possible combinations, out of which you can use just one. Four qubits in superposition, however, can be in all of those 16 combinations at once. This number grows exponentially with each extra qubit. Twenty of them can already store a million values in parallel. A really weird and unintuitive property qubits can have is Entanglement, a close connection that makes each of the qubits react to a change in the other's state instantaneously, no matter how far they are apart. This means when measuring just one entangled qubit, you can directly deduce properties of it's partners without having to look. Qubit Manipulation is a mind bender as well. A normal logic gate gets a simple set of inputs and produces one definite output. A quantum gate manipulates an input of superpositions, rotates probabilities, and produces another superposition as its output. So a quantum computer sets up some qubits, applies quantum gates to entangle them and manipulate probabilities, then finally measures the outcome, collapsing superpositions to an actual sequence of 0s and 1s. What this means is that you get the entire lot of calculations that are possible with your setup, all done at the same time. Ultimately, you can only measure one of the results and it'll only probably be the one you want, so you may have to double check and try again. But by cleverly exploiting superposition and entanglement, this can be exponentially more efficient than would ever be possible on a normal computer. So, while quantum computers will not probably not replace our home computers, in some areas, they are vastly superior. One of them is database searching. To find something in a database, a normal computer may have to test every single one of its entries. Quantum computers algorithms need only the square root of that time, which for large databases, is a huge difference The most famous use of quantum computers is ruining IT security. Right now, your browsing, email, and banking data is being kept secure by an encryption system in which you give everyone a public key to encode messages only you can decode. The problem is that this public key can actually be used to calculate your secret private key. Luckily, doing the necessary math on any normal computer would literally take years of trial and error. But a quantum computer with exponential speed-up could do it in a breeze. Another really exciting new use is simulations. Simulations of the quantum world are very intense on resources, and even for bigger structures, such as molecules, they often lack accuracy. So why not simulate quantum physics with actual quantum physics? Quantum simulations could provide new insights on proteins that might revolutionize medicine. Right now, we don't know if quantum computers will be just a specallized tool, or a big revolution for humanity. We have no idea where the limits of technology are, and there's only one way to find out.

That\\'s really impressive, until you learn that in the first quarter of 2015, seven hundred and twenty-five of the 1000 most-viewed videos on Facebook were stolen, amassing a total of 17 billion views. Sites and content aggregators steal videos from YouTube to go viral on Facebook. These videos go viral because Facebook is cheating. They rig their algorithms so that videos uploaded into their player are preferred to YouTube links, because users should be kept as long as possible on the site so Facebook can show them as many ads as possible. This is after all their business model. But it also cheats when it comes to views. A view is counted after three seconds even if the video is muted. Which means that because of autoplay, if you scroll through your timeline slowly enough, you count as a viewer. That means engagement is terrible, compared to Youtube views, Facebook views plummet after a few seconds, because most views are not real. But large numbers are impressive, so Facebook keeps pretending. While this forced virality is weird, the real problem is the so called \"Freebooting\", the stealing of videos. Since Facebook prefers its own player, stolen videos reach way more people than the original. Lately, this has happened to us more and more often. The most recent example amassed 3.2 million views and 140,000 shares in 2 days, while our old post just reached 100,000 people and got shared 1000 times. Other creators are hit even harder, SmarterEveryDay\\'s videos get stolen constantly, getting viewed up to 17 million times. But even this is dwarfed by examples like Tyrese Gibson, a singer who steals viral videos like this one with 86 million views on his Facebook page. He adds a link to buy his music, too. He\\'s not alone in this, a whole group of people have built their online presence around stealing other people\\'s work. This is really bad for independent creators. Contrary to popular belief, stolen content gives creators close to no exposure at all. Only the thief and Facebook profit from this. Quality content takes a lot of creativity, time and love. In our case, a single video literally takes hundreds of hours to make. Even we, with more than a million subscribers are dependent on the ads and exposure. Without ads, and the support of our generous patrons, we could not make videos. For a small creator, a viral video can be the difference between a career and a hobby. On YouTube, this kind of theft is not a problem, because they have major safeguards that protect content from being stolen. Although, the Content ID system is far from perfect, especially for film critics and gamers. Facebook, on the other hand, pretends everything is fine and constantly announces one milestone after the other. But things are not fine. Let\\'s look at the process of claiming your copyright on Facebook in the last year. One: get an e-mail or tweet from a fan, that gives you a direct link to your video. It\\'s not possible to search for your videos on Facebook yourself; you depend on luck to find your stolen videos. Two: search for \\'Facebook copyright infringement\\' on Google, because it\\'s actually faster this way. Three: fill out an annoyingly long contact form. Four: watch the views on your stolen videos rise. Five: Facebook finally pulls the video. Conveniently, the video has already gained 99% of all the views it will ever get. The thief doesn\\'t have to fear any negative consequences at all. This is what succesful creators have to deal with constantly, and on top of losing out in terms of exposure and money, it just feels like a violation to be treated like that. In a recent statement, Facebook announced they want to change. But it\\'s hard to take them seriously when it still takes days for a stolen viral video to be taken down, and Facebook does not share the profits made from it. At this point, Facebook is not a partner creators look forward to working with. They\\'ve built their video empire on stolen content, and disregard for original content creators. This is absolutely unacceptable for a corporation worth billions of dollars. Facebook is already testing various monetization models that will give the uploaders a cut of the ad revenue. Which, with the current state of play, is troubling. Right now, this is mainly being tested with big media companies, but, as creators, we don\\'t feel like we\\'re being asked or taken into consideration by the giant business Facebook. What can you, as a viewer, to do help here? If you spot stolen content on Facebook, make a comment linking to the original content. Alert the original creator, because only they can file a copyright report. Share this video, or the one done by SmarterEveryDay. We all want the same thing: a free internet that\\'s the basis for creativity, community and great stuff. We sincerely hope that Facebook will soon become a partner instead an obstacle to this goal.

Through light, we could experience distant stars and look back at the beginning of existence itself. But, what is light? In a nutshell Light, is the smallest quantity of energy that can be transported A photon, an elementary particle without a real size That can't be split, only created or destroyed. Light also has a wave-particle duality being kind of a particle and a wave at the same time (although this is a lie) Also when we say light, we actually mean visible light which is a tiny part of the electromagnetic spectrum: energy in form of electromagnetic radiation. Electromagnetic radiation consist of an enormous range of wavelengths and frequencies. Gamma rays have the smallest wave lengths because they are the highest energy photons. But most gamma rays are just under ten picometers, which is still way smaller than a hydrogen atom. For reference, a hydrogen atom compared to a cent is about as big as a cent compared to the Moon. Visible light is in the middle of the spectrum in a range of about 400 nanometers to 700 nanometers: about the size of a bacteria. On the other end of the spectrum, radio waves can be up to 100 kilometers in diameter. The biggest wave lengths we know exist can span from 10,000 kilometers to a baffling 100,000 kilometers, way larger than Earth. From a physics stand point, all these different waves are the same. They all have the wave-particle duality and travel at 'c', the speed of light, just at different frequencies. So what makes visible light special, then? Well... Absolutly nothing. We just happen to have evolved eyes, that are good at registering exactly this part of the electromagnetic spectrum. This is not a complete coincidence though. Visible light is the only set of electromagnetic radiation that propagates when in water, which happens to be where most eyes first evolved, millions of years ago. That was a smart move, because light not only interacts with matter, it's also altered by it and can be used to gather information about the world around us,with almost no delay. Which is arguably really helpful for survival. Okay, where does light come from? A vast range of electromagnetic waves are created when atoms or molecules drop from a higher state of energy to a lower one. They lose energy and emit it in the form of radiation. At the microscopic level, visible light is created when an electron within an atom in an excited state drops to a lower energy state and loses this excess energy. The same way, incoming light can elevate an electron to a higher state of energy by being absorbed by it. Macroscopically, the moving charge of the electron creates an oscillating magnetic field, Which creates an oscillating electric field perpendicular to it. These two fields move themselves through space, transferring energy from one place to another, carrying information about its place of creation with it. Why of all the things in the universe is light the fastest thing there is? Let's change the question: What is the fastest way to travel through space in the universe? It's c, exactly two hundred ninety-nine million, seven hundred ninety-two thousand, four hundred and fifty-eight metres per second in a vacuum, one billion kilometres per hour. Electromagnetic radiation just happens to move this fast. Any particle that has no mass travels at c, without acceleration or any in between. The light that has released from a candle does not speed up until it reaches light speed, At the very instant of its creation, its speed is c. So why is c, the speed of light, finite then? Well, nobody knows. Our universe is just built this way. We don't have the smart answer here. So light is part of a spectrum, an elementary particle that also behaves like a wave, Propelled by two perpendicular fields, travelling at the speed limit of the universe. Okay, that's nice and all, but what about the crazy stuff about travelling at the speed of light, and time, the twin paradox, quantum stuff, things like that? We would have to save them for another video. For now, let's be happy that we've evolved eyes that pick up waves of information permeating the universe. Making us see things and put our existence into perspective.\", \"Matter, as we know it; Atoms, stars and galaxies, planets and \\ntrees, rocks and us. This matter accounts for less than\\n5% of the known universe. About 25% is dark matter; \\nand 70% is dark energy. Both of which are invisible. This is kind of strange because it\\nsuggests that everything we experience is really only a tiny fraction of reality. But it gets worse. We really have no clue what dark matter\\nand energy are, or how they work. We are pretty sure they exist though. So, what do we know? Dark matter is the stuff that makes \\nit possible for galaxies to exist. When we calculated why the universe\\nis structured the way it is, it quickly became clear that there's just\\nnot enough normal matter. The gravity of the visible matter\\nis not strong enough to form galaxies and complex structures. The stars would more likely be scattered\\nall over the place and not form galaxies. So, we know there is something else inside\\nand around them. Something that doesn't\\nemit or reflect light. Something dark... but besides being able to calculate\\nthe existence of dark matter, we can see it... kind of. Places with a high concentration of dark\\nmatter bend light passing near by. So we know there's something there that\\ninteracts with gravity. Right now, we have more ideas about\\nwhat dark energy is not, than what it is! We know dark matter is not just clouds of\\nnormal matter without stars, because it would emit particles\\nwe could detect. Dark matter is not anti-matter, because anti-matter produces unique gamma\\nrays when it reacts with normal matter. Dark matter is also not\\nmade up of black holes, very compact objects that violently affect\\ntheir surroundings, while dark matter seems to be\\nscattered all over the place. Basically, we only know 3 things for sure; 1. Something is out there. 2. It interacts with gravity. 3. There is a lot of it. Dark matter is probably made up of a \\ncomplicated exotic particle that doesn't interact with \\nlight and matter in a way we expect, but right now, we just don't know. Dark energy is even more\\nstrange and mysterious. We can't detect it, we can't measure it\\nand we can't taste it. But we do see its effects very clearly. In 1929, Edward Hubble examined how \\nthe wavelength of light emitted by distant galaxies, shifts\\ntowards the red end of the electromagnetic spectrum\\nas it travels through the space. He found that fainter, more distant galaxies\\nshowed a large degree of red shift; closer galaxies, not so much. Hubble determined that this was because\\nthe universe itself is expanding. The red shift occurs,\\nbecause the wavelengths of light are stretched as the universe expands. More recent discoveries have shown that, \\nthe expansion of the universe is accelerating. Before that, it was thougth that the pull\\nof gravity would cause the expansion to either slow down or even retract and \\ncollapse in on itself at some point. Space doesn't change its properties\\nas it expands; there's just more of it. New space is constantly\\ncreated everywhere, galaxies are tight bound clusters of stuff\\nheld together by gravity so we don't experience this expansion\\nin our daily lives. But we see it everywhere around us. Wherever there is empty space in the \\nuniverse, more is forming every second. So, dark energy seems to be some\\nkind of energy intrinsic to empty space. Energy that is stronger than\\nanything else we know and it keeps getting stronger\\nas time passes by. Empty space has more energy than\\neverything else in the universe combined. We have multiple ideas about \\nwhat dark energy might be. One idea is, the dark energy is not\\na thing, but just a property of space. Empty space is not nothing, it has its own\\nenergy. It can generate more space and\\nis quite active. So, as the universe expands,\\nit could be that just more and more space appears to fill the gaps and this leads\\nto a faster expanding universe. This idea is close to an idea that \\nEinstein had back in 1917, of the concept of a cosmological constant, a force that counteracted\\nthe force of gravity. The only problem is, that when we tried\\nto calculate the amount of this energy the result was so wrong and weird,\\nthat it only added to the confusion. Another idea is, that empty space is\\nactually full of temporary, virtual particles that \\nspontaneously and continually form from nothing and then dissapear into\\nnothing again. The energy form those particles\\ncould be dark energy. Or maybe dark energy is an unknown kind of\\ndynamic energy fluid or field which permeates the entire universe,\\nbut somehow has the opposite effect on the universe than normal\\nenergy and matter. But if it exists, we don't know\\nhow and where or how we could detect it. So there are still a lot of questions to\\nanswer. Our theories about dark matter and\\ndark energy are still just that; theories. On one hand, this is kind of frustrating,\\non the other hand this is frontier science making it very exciting. It shows us that no matter how much\\nwe feel we're on top of things, we are still very much\\napes with smartphones, on a tiny fragile island in space looking into\\nthe sky wondering how our universe works There is so much left to learn,\\nand that is awesome.

Is it a black hole with\\nthe mass of a coin, or is it as wide as a coin? Suppose a US nickel with\\nthe mass of about 5 grams magically collapsed into a black hole. This black hole would have a radius\\nof about 10 to the power of −30 meters. By comparison, a hydrogen atom is about\\n10 to the power of −11 meters. So the black hole compared\\nto an atom is as small as an atom compared to the Sun. Unimaginably small! And a small black hole would also have\\nan unimaginably short lifetime to decay by Hawking radiation. It would radiate away what little mass it\\nhas in 10 to the power of −23 seconds. Its 5 grams of mass will be converted\\nto 450 terajoules of energy, which will lead to an explosion\\nroughly 3 times bigger than the atomic bombs dropped on\\nHiroshima and Nagasaki combined. In this case, you die. You also lose the coin. If the black hole had the\\ndiameter of a common coin, then it would be considerably\\nmore massive. In fact, a black hole with\\nthe diameter of a nickel would be slightly more\\nmassive than the Earth. It would have a surface gravity\\na billion billion times greater than our planet currently does. Its tidal forces on you would be so strong that they’d rip your\\nindividual cells apart. The black hole would consume you before\\nyou even realized what’s happening. Although the laws of gravity\\nare still the same, the phenomenon of gravity that you’d\\nexperience would be very different around such dense objects. The range of the gravitational attraction extends over the entire\\nobservable universe, with gravity getting weaker the farther\\naway you are from something. On Earth right now, your head and your\\ntoes are approximately the same distance from the center of our planet. But if you stood on\\na nickel-sized black hole, your feet would be hundreds\\nof times closer to the center, and the gravitational force would be\\ntens of thousands of times as large as the force on your head and\\nrip you into a billion pieces. But the black hole wouldn’t\\nstop with just you. The black hole is now a\\ndominant gravitational piece of the\\nEarth–Moon–Black-Hole-of-Death system. You might think that the black hole would\\nsink towards the center of the planet and consume it from the inside out. In fact, the Earth also moves up onto\\nthe black hole and begins to bob around, as if it were orbiting the black hole, all while having swathes of\\nmass eaten with each pass, which is much more creepy. As the Earth is eaten up from the inside, it collapses into a\\nscattered disk of hot rock, surrounding the black hole\\nin a tight orbit. The black hole slowly doubles its mass\\nby the time it’s done feeding. The Moon’s orbit is now highly elliptical. The effects on the Solar system\\nare awesome— in the Biblical sense of awesome,\\nwhich means terrifying. Tidal forces from the black hole would\\nprobably disrupt the near-Earth asteroids, maybe even parts of the asteroid belt, sending rocks careening\\nthrough the Solar system. Bombardment and impacts\\nmay become commonplace for the next few million years. The planets are slightly perturbed, but\\nstay approximately in the same orbit. The black hole we used\\nto call Earth will now continue on orbiting\\nthe Sun in the Earth’s place. In this case, you also die. This bonus video was made possible\\nby your contributions on Patreon.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community', 'There are probably 10,000 stars for every grain of sand on Earth, in the observable universe. We know that there might be trillions of planets. So where are all the aliens? This is the Fermi Paradox. If you want to know more about it, watch part one. Here we look at possible solutions to the Fermi Paradox. So will we be destroyed or does a glorious future await us? Space travel is hard. Although possible, it\\'s an enormous challenge to travel to other stars. Massive amounts of materials have to be put into orbit and assembled. A journey of maybe thousands of years needs to be survived by a population big enough to start from scratch. And the planet might be not as hospitable as it seems from afar. It was already extremely hard to set up a spaceship that could survive the trip. An interstellar invasion might be impossible to pull off. Also, consider time: the Universe is very old. On Earth there\\'s been life for at least 3.6 billion years. Intelligent human life for about 250,000 years. But only for about a century have we had the technology to communicate over great distances. There might have been grand alien empires that stretched across thousands of systems and existed for millions of years and we might just have missed them. There might be grandiose ruins rotting away on distant worlds. 99% of all species on Earth have died out. It\\'s easy to argue that this will be our fate sooner or later. Intelligent life may develop, spread over a few systems and die off, over and over again. But galactic civilizations might never meet. So maybe it\\'s a unifying experience for life in the Universe to look at the stars and wonder \"Where is everyone?\" But there is no reason to assume aliens are like us, or that our logic applies to them. It might just be that our means of communication are extremely primitive and outdated. Imagine sitting in a house with a Morse code transmitter: you\\'d keep sending messages but nobody would answer, and you would feel pretty lonely. Maybe we\\'re still undetectable for intelligent species and we\\'ll remain so until we learn to communicate properly. And even if we met aliens we might be too different to be able to communicate with them in a meaningful way. Imagine the smartest squirrel you can, no matter how hard you try, you won\\'t be able to explain our society to it. After all, from the squirrel\\'s perspective, a tree is all that a sophisticated intelligence like itself needs to survive. So humans cutting down whole forests is madness; but we don\\'t destroy forests because we hate squirrels. We just want the resources. The squirrel\\'s wishes and the squirrel\\'s survival are of no concern to us. A Type 3 civilization in need of resources may treat us in a similar way. They might just evaporate our oceans to make collecting whatever they need easier. One of the aliens might think for a second \"Oh, tiny little apes! They built really cute concrete structures, oh well now they\\'re dead.\" before activating warp speed. But if there is a civilization out there that wants to eliminate other species, it\\'s far more likely that it will be motivated by culture rather than by economics. And anyway it will be more effective to automate the process by constructing the perfect weapon, a self replicating space probe made from nano-machines. They operate on a molecular level: incredibly fast and deadly, with the power to attack and dismantle anything in an instant. You only need to give them four instructions. One, find a planet with life. Two, disassemble everything on this planet into its component parts. Three, use the resources to build new space probes. Four, repeat. A doomsday machine like this could render a galaxy sterile in a few million years. But why would you fly light years to gather resources or commit genocide? The speed of light is actually... not very fast. If someone could travel at the speed of light, it will still take 100,000 years to cross the milky way once, and you\\'ll probably travel way slower. There might be way more enjoyable things than destroying civilizations and building empires. An interesting concept is the Matrioshka Brain. A mega-structure surrounding a star, a computer of such computing power that an entire species could upload their consciousness and exist in a simulated universe. Potentially, one could experience an eternity of pure ecstasies without ever being bored or sad, a perfect life. If built around a red dwarf, this computer could be powered for up to ten trillion years. Who would want to conquer the galaxy or make contact with other life forms, if this were an option? All these solutions to the Fermi Paradox have one problem. We don\\'t know where the borders of technology are. We could be close to the limit or nowhere near it. And super technology awaits us, granting us immortality, transporting us to other galaxies, elevating us to the level of gods. One thing we do have to acknowledge is that we really don\\'t know anything. Humans have spent more than 90% of their existence as hunter-gatherers. 500 years ago we thought we were the center of the universe. 200 years ago we stopped using human labors as the main source of the energy. 30 years ago we had apocalyptic weapons pointed at each other because of political disagreements. In the galactic time scale we are embryos. We\\'ve come far, but still have a long way to go. The mindset that we really are the center of the universe is still strong in humans, so it\\'s easy to make arrogant assumptions about life in the universe. But in the end, there\\'s only one way to find out, right? Hey, everybody! We finally have our own subreddit. Come by for surveys, discussions about future videos, FAQs, and stuff like that.

While some are juste stupid and funny, others promote ignorance and an unhealthy distrust. So we went to the Kurzgesagt lab and developed a foolproof system to destroy not all but a lot of conspiracy theories. It's really simple, just ask yourself: Does the theory affect really rich and powerful people? Is the answer yes? OK, then it's most likely... Not true. Let's test it on three examples. Number one: There is an easy cure for cancer but it's withheld because it would destroy the profits of pharma companies. Hmmm... Do really rich people die of cancer, like, I don't know, say the former CEO of Apple? Yes? There is no suppressed cure for cancer. Number two: Chemtrails, the theory that airplanes spray chimicals in the air for population control or some of the crazy reason. Do really powerful people breathe air? Do Obama or Putin breathe air? Yes? Chemtrails are not a thing. Number three: Apocalyptic conspiracy theories. The world will end soon because of the Antichrist, Mayas Aliens, someone says so. Do really rich and powerful people ignore the soon to be upon us and a very imminent apocalypse? Yes? The world will not end soon. This obviously doesn't works for every conspiracy theory out there But it does works for some of the most stupid ones. So the next time someone tries to convince you that the Illuminati put stuff in you water, just show him this video and maybe be a bit more selective about your friends on Facebook.\", 'Life is fundamentally different\\nfrom dead stuff—or is it? Physicist Erwin Schrödinger\\ndefined life this way: Living things avoid decay into\\ndisorder and equilibrium. What does this mean? Let’s pretend that your download\\nfolder is the universe. It started orderly and got more\\nand more chaotic over time. By investing energy, you can create\\norder and clean it up. This is what living things do. But what is life? Every living thing on this\\nplanet is made of cells. Basically, a cell is a protein-based robot\\ntoo small to feel or experience anything. It has the properties we just\\nassign to life: it has a wall that separates it from the\\nsurroundings, creating order; it regulates itself and maintains\\na constant state; it eats stuff to stay alive; it grows and develops; it reacts to the environment; and it’s subject to evolution; and it makes more of itself. But of all the stuff that makes up\\na cell, no part is alive. Stuff reacts chemically with other stuff,\\nforming reactions that start other reactions which\\nstart other reactions. In a single cell, every second several\\nmillion chemical reactions take place, forming a complex orchestra. A cell can build several thousand\\ntypes of protein: some very simple, some complex\\nmicromachines. Imagine driving a car at 100 km/h while\\nconstantly rebuilding every single part of it with stuff you collect\\nfrom the street. That is what cells do. But no part of the cell is alive;\\neverything is dead matter moved by the laws of the universe. So is life the aggregate of all these\\nreaction processes that are taking place? Eventually, every living thing will die. The goal of the whole process is to\\nprevent this by producing new entities; and by this, we mean DNA. Life is, in a way, just a lot of stuff\\nthat carries genetic information around. Every living thing is subject to\\nevolution, and the DNA that develops the best living\\nthing around it will stay in the game. So, is DNA life, then? If you take DNA out of its hull,\\nit certainly is a very complex molecule, but it can’t do anything by itself. This is where viruses make everything\\nmore complicated. They are basically strings of RNA\\nor DNA in a small hull and need cells to do something. We’re not sure if they count as\\nliving or dead. And still, there are 225,000,000 m³\\nof viruses on Earth. They don’t seem to care what\\nwe think of them. There are even viruses that invade\\ndead cells and reanimate them so they can be a host for them, which\\nblurs the line even more. Or mitochondria. They are the power plants of\\nmost complex cells and were previously free living bacteria that\\nentered a partnership with bigger cells. They still have their own DNA and can\\nmultiply on their own, but they are not alive anymore; they are dead. So they traded their own life for the\\nsurvival of their DNA, which means living things can evolve into\\ndead things as long as it’s beneficial to their genetic code. So, maybe life is information that manages\\nto ensure its continued existence. But what about AI\\n(artificial intelligence)? By our most common definitions, we are\\nvery close to creating artificial life in computers. It’s just a question of time before the\\ntechnology we build gets there. And this is not science fiction, either; there are a lot of smart people\\nactively working on this. You could already argue that computer\\nviruses are alive. Hm, okay. So what is life, then? Things, processes, DNA, information? This got confusing very fast. One thing is for sure: the idea that life is fundamentally\\ndifferent from non-living things because they contain some\\nnon-physical element or are governed by different principles\\nthan inanimate objects turned out to be wrong. Before Charles Darwin, humans drew a line\\nbetween themselves and the rest of living things; there was something\\nmagical about us that made us special. Once we had to accept we are like every\\nliving being, a product of evolution, we drew a different line. But the more we learn about what\\ncomputers can do and how life works, the closer we get to creating the first\\nmachine that fits our desciption of life, the more our image of ourselves\\nis in danger again. And this will happen sooner or later. And here’s another question for you: if everything in the universe is made\\nof the same stuff, does this mean everything\\nin the universe is dead or that everything in the universe\\nis alive? That it’s just a question of complexity? Does this mean we can never die because we were never alive\\nin the first place? Is life and death an irrelevant question\\nand we haven’t noticed it yet? Is it possible we are much more part of\\nthe universe around us than we thought? Don’t look at us; we don’t have any\\nanswers for you. Just questions for you to think about. After all, it’s thinking about questions\\nlike this that makes us feel alive and gives us some comfort. Subtitles by the Amara.org community', \"Violence and war. The insane brutality of ISIS continues, the Russians are invading Ukraine, and the Palestinians and Israelis continue to slug it out. Does that make you feel gloomy? Well don't. Because if you look at the numbers war actually seems to be going out of fashion, while the global population is at an all time high. It seems that we live in the most peaceful period in human history. How is this possible? (music) As of September 2014, there were 4 conflicts going on in the world that'd caused at least 10,000 people to die since January 2013. 9 conflicts that killed more than 1,000 people and 13 that killed more than 100 since January 2013. Not really peaceful, but consider this: of all the conflicts going on none is an active war between countries. They are either civil wars or local conflicts. Although civil wars are terrible and cause huge suffering, their impact is usually way smaller than a war between nations or empires. When two nations engage in war, they can mobilise much bigger forces, have access to all of the state's resources and logistics and almost all of the population. So why have we transitioned from wars between nation states wars between nation states A lot of it is to do with colonialism and the cold war. When the cold war ended, a major driver of armed conflicts vanished too. But the break up of the communist dictatorships revealed new or old tensions and brought new conflicts in the now freed states which often resulted in civil war. Much more importantly, in 1945, nearly all of Africa, much of Asia, and parts of Latin America were under colonial rule. By 1990, all but a few islands were independent. But wait. Couldn't you argue that what today's multinational corporations are doing in the third world is just as bad as colonialism? Let's look at Congo. It was established as a colony in 1885 by the Belgium king. An area 80 times the size of Belgium. Violence committed against the indigenous Congolese and the ruthless system of economic exploitation had killed about half of the population by 1908. About 10 million Congolese were executed or starved to death. Millions were mutilated and traumatised. The economic exploitation of the Congo remained the top priority and forced labor never really ceased completely until the end of Belgium rule in 1960. Which is not really that long ago. So, no. Colonialism was much worse than vulture capitalism is today and it ended just two generations ago. Most of the conflicts that are going on right now are in areas that 60 years ago were under foreign control. But things are getting better. Until 1989, victory for one side in a civil war was common while nowadays victories are much rarer. At the same time, negotiated endings have jumped from 10% to almost 40%. What about the rest of the world? Why have nation states stopped attacking each other? There are 4 major reasons: One. Democratisation. The steady development from autocracy to democracy. Democracies hardly ever fight each other. Of all the state against state wars fought since 1900, only a minority were fought between democracies. Two. Globalisation. War is just not as effective at achieving economic goals as it used to be. Today it's almost always cheaper to buy resources on the global market than to cease them by force. People from other nations are more valuable to us alive than dead. Which, overall, is a pretty new concept. Three. War is so 20th century. Until World War I, warfare was seen as an inevitable part of the human experience and as a valuable tool which you could use to achieve goals when diplomacy hit a brick wall. Today we have rules that declare acts of aggression illegal and stipulate that armed forces is only justified in self-defence or with the authority of the UN Security Council. These rules are still broken but today it's harder to do so without sparking oppositions and disapproval. Also, we have an international court for war crimes in The Hague. And that's a very recent innovation. Four. Borders are mostly fixed now. After World War II, territorial wars generally stopped when most countries pledged to accept international borders and respect other nations autonomy. But is all of this just an anomaly or are we on the road to lasting peace? Truth is we don't know yet. We need a big enough sample to rule out the historical average, which is about one or two big wars per century. We just haven't had enough time since World War II to rule out the possibility that war is not going away. If we don't have one major war in the next 75 years, we can be really confident that humanity is changing. So you see, war might be over. Yes there are nasty conflicts going on in many places but overall, things are getting better. And we can make them even better by speaking up for peace and democracy. Subtitles by the Amara.org community\", 'Neutron stars are one of the\\nmost extreme things in the universe. They’re like giant atom cores. Kilometers in diameter,\\nunbelievably dense and violent. But how can something\\nlike this even exist? The life of a star is dominated\\nby two forces being in balance. Its own gravity and the radiation\\npressure of its fusion reaction. In the core of stars, hydrogen\\nis fused into helium. Eventually, the hydrogen\\nin the core is exhausted. If the star is massive enough,\\nhelium is now fused into carbon. The cores of these massive\\nstars become layered like onions, as heavier and heavier atomic\\nnuclei build up at the center. Carbon is fused into neon, which leads\\nto oxygen, which leads to silicon. Eventually, the fusion reaction hits iron,\\nwhich cannot fuse into another element. When the fusion stops, the\\nradiation pressure drops rapidly. The star is no longer in balance, and if its core mass exceeds\\nabout 1.4 solar masses, a catastrophic collapse takes place. The outer part of the core reaches\\nvelocities of up to 70,000 km/s, as it collapses towards\\nthe center of the star. Now, only the fundamental\\nforces inside an atom are left to fight the\\ngravitational collapse. The quantum-mechanical repulsion\\nof electrons is overcome, and electrons and protons\\nfuse into neutrons packed as densely as an atomic nucleus. The outer layers of the star\\nare catapulted into space in a violent supernova explosion. So, now we have a neutron star! Its mass is between 1 and 3 Suns, but compressed to an object\\nabout 25 kilometers wide! And 500,000 times the mass\\nof Earth, in this tiny ball that’s roughly the diameter of Manhattan. It’s so dense that one cubic\\ncentimeter of neutron star contains the same mass as an\\niron cube 700 meters across. That’s roughly 1 billion tons,\\nas massive as Mount Everest, in a space the size of a sugar cube. Neutron star gravity\\nis pretty impressive too! If you were to drop an object from\\n1 meter over the surface, it would hit the star in one microsecond\\nand accelerate up to 7.2 million km/h. The surface is superflat, with\\nirregularities of 5 millimeters maximum, with a superthin atmosphere of hot plasma. The surface temperature\\nis about 1 million kelvin, compared to 5,800 kelvin for our Sun. Let’s look inside the neutron star! The crust is extremely hard\\nand is most likely made of an iron atom nuclei lattice with a sea\\nof electrons flowing through them. The closer we get to the core, the more\\nneutrons and the fewer protons we see until there’s just an incredibly dense\\nsoup of indistinguishable neutrons. The cores of neutron stars\\nare very, very weird. We are not sure what their properties are,\\nbut our closest guess is superfluid neutron degenerate matter or some kind of ultradense quark\\nmatter called quark-gluon plasma. That does not make any sense\\nin the traditional way and can only exist in such an\\nultraextreme environment. In many ways, a neutron star\\nis similar to a giant atom core. The most important difference is that atom\\ncores are held together by strong interaction\\nand neutron stars by gravity. As if all this wasn’t extreme enough, let’s take a look at\\na few other properties. Neutron stars spin very, very fast,\\nyoung ones several times per second. And if there’s a poor star nearby\\nto feed the neutron star, it can rotate up to several\\nhundred times per second. Like the object PSRJ1748-2446ad. It spins at approximately\\n252 million km/h. This is so fast that the star has\\na rather strange shape. We call these objects pulsars, because\\nthey emit a strong radio signal. And the magnetic field of a neutron star is roughly 8 trillion times stronger\\nthan the magnetic field of Earth. So strong that atoms get bent\\nwhen they enter its influence. Okay, I think we got the point across. Neutron stars are some\\nof the most extreme, but also some of the\\ncoolest objects in the universe. Hopefully, we will one day send spaceships\\nto learn more about them and take some neat pictures! But we shouldn’t get too close! Subtitles by the Amara.org community', 'Planet Earth is the home of every lifeform, known to us, in the universe. Its age is about 1/3 of the age of the universe and, admitted, It is a thing of beauty. a slightly squashed fair with a heavy metal core,  and a lighter surface crust,  wrapped in a thin sliver of sweet air to breathe, with vast oceans, fertile plains,  magnificent mountains,  fresh water rivers, streams, lakes and aquifers,  orbiting a star which warms us, and gives us energy. But how did our home come in to existence,  and what\\'s it made of? 4.6 billion years ago,  Earth was created from the remnants of dead stars, that collected in a giant, dirty gas cloud. The gas cloud became denser in its center, and formed an accretion disk.  small particles started clumping together,  and building larger and larger objects,  until they form the objects we call \"Planets\" today. This process took 10 to 20 million years,  and is still not very well understood. At about this time, when the solar system was young and chaotic, a giant object, about as big as Mars, collided with our home. The impact was violent,  and if the object had been more massive, it might have destroyed Earth. Materials from Earth were smashed out into orbit, and formed the Moon, which is the biggest satellite in relation to its planet in the solar system. At this time, Earth was a hot hell, constantly being hit by asteroids,  with seas of lava,  and a toxic atmosphere. But something was about to change drastically. Earth cooled down. Water from the inside of the Earth wandered to the surface and rained down on Earth,  only to vaporize again and become clouds. Millions of asteroids brought more and more water to our planet. All the water on Earth has about this volume compared to Earth. Today,  the surface of Earth is 71% water,  and 29% land. 97.5% is saline water,  while only 2.5% is fresh water. The Fresh water is 69% ice and snow,  30% are ground waters,  and only about 1% make up the remaining ground waters. But even this small part is mostly frozen. Only a tiny part of our water is actually lakes and rivers. and an even tinier part is bound in living things. So, gradually the Earth cooled down,  and the surface formed a thin crust. But inside the earth, hot rock continue to swirl about,  moving the crust from below and breaking it apart. This process is called \"Plate Tectonics\",  and is happening right now. We\\'ll make a whole video about it in the future. For now, let\\'s just say that the crust of Earth consisted of separate giant plates that move around. As they meet, they crumble, and create mighty mountains. OR: violently plunge back down, deeper into Earth, creating deep trenches. That\\'s the way the highest place on Earth was formed: Mt.Everest, and the deepest: the Mariana Trench. From our perspective,  Earth\\'s mountains and trenches are mighty indeed,  but when you look at the Earth in cross-section, you can see how tiny they actually are. The part we stand on is the crust, which is about 50 kilometers thick, though it can vary between 5 and 70 kilometers  By the way, the deepest hole ever drilled by man is 12.262 kilometers deep. After the crust, comes the mantle. It\\'s a silicate rocky shell,  and about 2,900 kilometers thick. The mantle consists of the upper mantle, and the lower mantle. The upper mantle has different regions, too. It\\'s upper part, which is viscous and carries the crust, is called the \"Lithosphere.\" After that, there comes the \"Asthenosphere,\" which consists of less mobile, mostly solid material. The lower mantle reaches deep down to the outer core of Earth. Earth\\'s outer core is a liquid layer of iron and nickel,  about 2,266 kilometers thick. Temperatures vary from 4,000℃(7,232℉) to 5,700℃(10,292℉). And in the center, is the inner core. It\\'s mostly solid,  a ball made of an iron-nickel alloy. with a radius of about 1,200 kilometers. 70% of the size of the moon,  and about the temperature of the surface of the Sun. It is slowly growing at an estimated rate of about 1mm/year. Now, for some respective, this small layer of crystallized melt products of former molten mantle, is where we live. Then, there\\'s Earth\\'s magnetic field. It\\'s an invisible phenomenon that diverts high energy particles coming from the Sun and other sources, allowing for a stable environment with comparatively little radiation impact on Earth. But why is it there? Actually, we don\\'t really know a terrible lot about that. We know, it has something to do with the core of Earth. Inside this metal sphere, large electrical currents flow in complicated patterns. They cause a magnetic field,  that sort of stabilizes itself according to the laws of electrodynamics. This entire system is called the \"Dynamo.\" But, don\\'t let us fool you into thinking we have it all figured out. Speaking of breathtaking information, what about the airy stuff that surrounds us? By volume, dry air consists mostly of Nitrogen,  Oxygen, Argon, Carbon, a variable mount of water vapor, and small amounts of other gases. Humans are very dependent on the lowest layer of the atmosphere:  the Troposphere - Where the weather is. It\\'s 12 kilometers thick on average. Above that is the Stratosphere, which is where the ozone layer protects us from the sun\\'s most aggressive type of light. Above that is the Mesosphere - the coolest place on Earth, with an average temperature around -85℃(-121℉). At about 80 kilometers up, the Thermosphere starts. The transition to space is a fluent one, without clear borders. but humans decided that space starts here. At about 100 kilometers, Earth stops, and space begins, though the atmosphere extends a bit further. In this region, we find the Ionosphere, the aurora borealis, and the ISS, and the outermost layer is the Exosphere, stretching up to 10,000 kilometers. It merges fluently with outer space, where there\\'s no atmosphere at all. The atoms and molecules in this area are so far apart, that they can travel hundreds of kilometers  without colliding with each other. OK. Humans, in their present form, have only been around for 200,000 years. - that\\'s 0.004% of Earth\\'s history. Not long, really. And, here we are now, living in a thin, moist layer on a small, wet rock. We call this rock: Earth. It is the product of the universe\\'s deepest workings, the result of a constant process of creation and destruction, happening all of the universe, all the time, helped by chance, the laws of the universe and random events, we are really lucky.', 'Every second of your life, you are under attack.

So, what happens in the case of an infection? *Intro* It\\'s a beautiful day, when suddenly, a wild rusty nail appears and you cut yourself. The first barrier of the immune system is breached: your skin. Nearby bacteria seize on the opportunity and enter your wound. They start using up the body\\'s resources and double their numbers about every 20 minutes. At first, they fly under the radar, but when a certain bacteria population is reached, they change their behavior and start to damage the body by changing the environment around them. The immune system has to stop them as fast as possible. First of all, your guard cells, known as macrophages, intervene. They are huge cells that guard every border region of the body. Most of the time, they alone can suffocate an attack because they can devour up to 100 intruders each. They swallow the intruder whole and trap it inside a membrane. Then the enemy gets broken down by enzymes and is killed. On top of that, they cause inflammation by ordering the blood vessels to release water into the battlefield so fighting becomes easier. You notice this as a very mild swelling. When the macrophages fight for too long, they call in heavy backup by releasing messenger proteins that communicate location and urgency. Neutrophils leave their patrol routes in the blood and move to the battlefield. The neutrophils fight so furiously that they kill healthy cells in the process. On top of that, they generate barriers that trap and kill the bacteria. They are, indeed, so deadly that they evolved to commit suicide after five days to prevent them from causing too much damage. If this is not enough to stop the invasion, the brain of the immune system kicks in. The dendritic cell gets active. It reacts to the signals of the soldiers and starts collecting samples from the enemies. They rip them into pieces and present the parts on their outer layer. Now, the dendritic cell makes a crucial decision. Should they call for anti-virus forces that eradicate infected body cells or an army of bacteria killers? In this case, anti-bacteria forces are necessary. It then travels to the closest lymph node in about a day. Here, billions of helper and killer T cells are waiting to be activated. When T cells are born they go trough a difficult and complicated training process and only a quarter survives. The surviving cells are equipped with a specific set-up. And the denditric cell is on its way looking for a helper T cell with the set-up that\\'s just right. It\\'s looking for a helper T cell that can bind the parts of the intruders which the dendritic cell has presented on its membrane. When it finally finds one, a chain reaction takes place. The helper T cell is activated. It quickly duplicates thousands of times. Some become memory T cells that stay in the lymph node and will make you practically immune against this enemy. Some travel to the field of battle to help out. And the third group goes on to travel to the center of the lymph node to activate a very powerful weapons factory. Like the T cells, they are born with a specific set-up and when a B cell and a T cell with the same set-up meet, hell breaks loose. The B cell duplicates rapidly and starts producing millions of little weapons. They work so hard that they would literally die from exhaustion very fast. Here, helper T cells play another important role; they stimulate the hard working factories and tell them: \"Don\\'t die yet, we still need you, keep going!\" This also ensures that the factories die if the infection is over so the body doesn\\'t waste energy or hurt itself. But what is produced by the B cells? You\\'ve heard of them of course, antibodies. Little proteins that are engineered to bind to the surface of the specific intruder. There are even different kinds of antibodies that have slightly different jobs. The helper T cells tell the plasma cells which type is needed the most in this particular invasion. Millions of them flood the blood and saturate the body. Meanwhile, at the site of infection, the situation is getting dire. The intruders have multiplied in number and start hurting the body. Guard and attack cells fight hard, but also die in the process. Helper T cells support them by ordering them to be more aggressive and to stay alive longer. But without help they can\\'t overwhelm the bacteria. But now, the second line of defense arrives. Billions of antibodies flood the battlefield and disable lots of the intruders, rendering them helpless or killing them in the process. They also stun the bacteria and make them an easy target. Their back is built to connect to killer cells, so they can connect and kill the enemy more easily. Macrophages are especially good at nomming up the bacteria which antibodies have attached to. Now the balance shifts. In a team effort, the infection is wiped out. At this point, millions of body cells have already died. No big deal, the losses are quickly replenished. Most immune cells are now useless and without the constant signals they commit suicide, so as not to waste any resources. But some stay behind: the memory cells. If this enemy is encountered ever again in the future, they will be ready for it and probably kill it before you even notice. This was a very, very simplified explanation of parts of the immune system at work. Can you imagine how complex this system is, even at this level, when we ignore so many players and all the chemistry. Life is awfully complicated, but if we take the time to understand it, we\\'ll encounter endless wonders and great beauty.', 'Oh dear… Just when you thought the Iraq\\nproblem was solved because you haven’t heard about it\\nfor a while, everything’s back to murderous\\nchaos and terror. What happened? In 2003, the US invaded Iraq because of\\nits alleged connections to terrorism and weapons of mass destruction. At the time, Saddam Hussein, a brutal\\ndictator, ruled the country. He was part of the Sunni minority and suppressed the Shia majority. Iraq was conquered fairly quickly, but the US had no plan for the country. The until-then suppressed Shia majority\\ntook over and began oppressing the Sunnis, because suppressing other faiths has\\nproven to be such a good idea. Unsurprisingly, a Sunni rebel\\nuprising began and terrorist groups, like al-Qaeda,\\ntrickled into Iraq and local forces, often former Sunni\\nmilitary, began fighting the US troops and the newly\\nformed Iraqi state, peaking in a bloody civil war in 2006. Since then, people in Iraq have basically\\nbeen segregated by religion. So, in a tragic irony of history, the US\\ninvasion led to the formation of the very terrorists the US wanted to\\neliminate in the first place, because Iraq was now the perfect training\\nground for terrorism. To understand this complicated conflict\\nbetter, we need to understand the relationship between the two main\\nbranches of the Muslim faith: Shia and Sunni Islam. Sunnis make up about 80% of the Muslim\\nworld and Shia about 20%. And the hard-liners on both sides don’t\\nlike each other very much. Saudi Arabia and Iran are the two most\\npowerful players in the game of faiths. They both have no separation of state and\\nreligion, domestic problems, and a lot of oil money. And they support groups that fight the\\nother religious orientation. And one of those terror organizations\\nsupported by Saudi Arabia was the Islamic State in Iraq,\\nor ISI for short. In 2010, the Arab Spring happened and changed the whole situation\\nin the Middle East. In Syria, dictator Bashar al-Assad didn’t\\nthink much of resigning and started a gruesome civil war\\nagainst his own people. The longer the war went on, the more\\nforeign groups joined the fight, most of them for religious reasons, and with the goal of building an\\nIslamic state in the region. And one of them was the infamous ISI,\\nwhich now became the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria,\\nor ISIS. They had fought in Iraq for years, and had thousands of well-trained and\\nfanatic soldiers. They already quasi-controlled parts of\\nnorthern Iraq and were very determined to build\\ntheir religious state. And they changed the game in Syria like\\nno-one expected. ISIS was so unbelievably violent and\\nradical that soon it was a war with almost every other faction of\\nthe Syrian rebel armies. They attacked and killed member of other\\nMuslim terrorist groups. In the territories they controlled, they\\nbuilt an Islamic state with rules so strict that even the\\nhard-liners of al-Qaeda and Saudi Arabia were shocked and withdrew their support. ISIS has been accused of responsibility\\nfor multiple massacres against civilians, countless suicide bombings, the\\nhostage-taking of women and children, the execution of their prisoners, and\\nbeheadings. All kinds of medieval hororrs we would\\nrather not have to illustrate. And this lovely gathering of human beings\\nrecently decided it was time to take more territory in Iraq. Since the US left Iraq, the Shia prime\\nminister, Nouri al-Maliki, has monopolized power and discriminated\\nagainst Sunnis wherever possible. The government of Iraq is widely regarded\\nas being corrupt, incapable, and it’s cetainly hated by a large part\\nof its citizens. The Iraqi army, consisting of about\\n300,000 soldiers, was created using 25 billion US dollars in\\ntax money, but it’s not loyal to its government and has been withdrawing or completely\\ndisbanding, giving up city after city. Because ISIS has announced that everyone\\nwho opposes them will be killed, they have proven they mean business. By June 2014, they’d conquered a big\\nchunk of Iraq, including Mosul, Iraq’s second-largest\\ncity. They’d stolen hundreds of millions from\\ncaptured banks, making them the richest terror\\norganization on Earth. And they are constantly working on\\nestablishing a super-medieval religious state. Iran and the US are even considering\\nworking together to fight them. That’s how gruesome the situation is. Events in Iraq show again that exploiting\\nthe people you’ve defeated in a war, denying them power, a living, and a stake\\nin the rebuilding of the country is just sowing the seeds of the next bout\\nof violence. Somehow, we have to break this circle. Subtitles by the Amara.org community', \"The 14 moons of Neptune \\nare a strange bunch. Most of them are small \\npotato shaped pieces of ice and rock. Some are so far away from Neptune that \\nthey need 29 years to circle Neptune once. Almost all of them are asteroids \\ntrapped by Neptune's gravity. 99.5% of all the mass around Neptune \\nis concentrated in Triton. It's the 7th biggest moon, and \\nmore massive than all other known moons in the solar system that are \\nsmaller than itself combined. Its surface area is about as big as the \\nmainland of Russia and Australia together. Also, Triton is one of only four objects \\nin the solar system that we know is geologically active. Triton orbits Neptune in the 'wrong' direction, \\nagainst the rotation of Neptune, which is unique in our solar system\\nfor an object as big as Triton. We can conclude from this that \\nTriton hasn't always been a moon of Neptune, but probably was a dwarf planet that \\nwas forced into submission by Neptune, when the solar system was younger \\nand more chaotic. The most popular theory here is that\\nTriton was once part of a double system, when Neptune migrated \\nto the outer edges of the solar system, its gravity interfered with the double system\\nand catapulted the other object into space, while Triton was forced into orbit. This would of disrupted the orbits \\nof other Neptune moons rather violently and would most likely have \\neither pushed them away from Neptune, or let them collide or crash into Neptune. This would explain why Neptune's moons \\nare so dominated by Triton. But, this will end one day, Triton is being slowed down by Neptune, and eventually, it will either crash into it, or be ground by Neptune's gravity into \\na huge ring system, similar to Saturn's. So, don't by real estate on Triton. Fixed English Subtiles by\\nMads Hagemann Nielsen - 2015 Subtitles by the Amara.org community\", \"The moons of Mars explained. Mars has two moons, Phobos and Deimos. They are really tiny. How tiny? Compared to Mars or our own moon, pretty tiny. Although, tiny is a matter of opinion. Their surface area is up close to some of the smallest states on Earth, like Luxembourg and Malta. Although Phobos and Deimos are in no way lightweight, In reality their gravitational pull isn't even strong enough to bring them into spherical form. So they look more like huge potatoes than moons. The most popular theory of their origin is that they were once part of the asteroid belt until Jupiter's massive gravity kicked them out of it. So Mars could catch them. Phobos orbits Mars at a average distance of 9,400 kilometers, once every 7 and a half hours. It's on a collision course, and gets 2 meters closer to Mars every year. In 50 to 100 million years, it will be either ripped to pieces by Mars' gravity, and be transformed into a beautiful ring, or it will crash into Mars. The energy released in this collision would kill everything on the small planet. So, if there are humans on Mars by then, they should build very strong bunkers. Smaller Deimos, on the other hand, is slowly escaping Mars. Eventually, it will fly off into space and leave a lonely red planet behind. So, in a few hundred million years, Mars will be moonless and on it's own. Unless, it manages to catch itself another asteroid.

But all they did was invent clever\\nways of using the internet. So the person who “invented the internet”\\nshould be a gazillionaire equivalent to, say, God, shoudn't they? Who should get the credit, then? Was it a British geek in a Swiss\\nunderground lab? Maybe. Clever Americans threatened with\\nnuclear annihilation by the Russians? Nice idea. French scientists who decided to call\\ntheir computer network the “Le Internet”? Interesting. Or was it thanks to a myriad of smart\\nscientists working on something they knew was useful, but didn’t realize\\nwould be so big? Well, let’s try and get some\\nfacts straight. There’s the internet, a whole bunch of\\ncomputer networks connected to each other, and then there’s the World Wide Web, a\\nway of making it easier to share information using all those\\ninterconnected computers. The internet as we know it today was at\\nleast 40 years in the making. One popular but wrong story is that the\\ninternet was developed by the USA so they had a communication network that\\nwould survive a nuclear war. According to one of the founders of the\\nfirst network, the ARPANET, in the 1960s, this first network experiment wasn’t about\\ncommunication at all; it was about optimizing processor usage,\\nor time-sharing, which basically meant that scientists\\ncould share computer power, too. That was because until the 1960s there was\\nbasically no network—you had big machines called mainframes which sat in the room\\nand processed computing tasks one at a time. With time-sharing, these behemoths could\\nprocess several tasks at a time, which meant their power could be used by\\nseveral scientists at once. And, obviously, once you start connecting\\ncomputers together, you start to wonder about\\nwhat you need to do to make communications\\nbetween them easier. Scientists around the world were trying to\\nsolve this problem. So let’s look at some other key concepts\\nthat were developed elsewhere. Starting with packet switching. In Britain, there was a commercial\\nnetwork, developed by the National Physical Laboratory, but which\\nnever really got off the ground because it didn’t get funding. But they did come up with the idea of\\npacket switching, a way of avoiding congestion in busy networks by\\ncutting up data at one end and putting it back together at the other. The French also played a role. They were working on a scientific network\\ncalled CYCLADES, but they didn’t have a big budget, so they\\ndecided to work on direct connections between computers, as opposed to working\\nwith gateway computers. Now, as an aside here, this, admittedly,\\nisn’t very scientific, but according to one theory, a spin-off of\\ntheir research was the word “internet”. But you don’t have to believe it\\nif you don’t want to. So, now it’s the early 1970s. There’s quite a lot of computer\\ninfrastructure, but communication is awkward and patchy, because different\\nnetworks can’t talk to each other. TCP/IP solves this problem. The TCP/IP protocols form the basic\\ncommunication language of the internet, which labels the packets of data\\nand makes sure that even though some pieces of the same data\\ntake a different route, they all arrive at their destination and\\ncan be reassembled. Networks really began communicating\\nwith each other in 1975, so you could argue that was\\nthe beginning of the internet. Email was also very important. It was developed for ARPANET in 1972. Most internet traffic in 1976 was email,\\nbecause academics thought electronic post-it notes were dead-core. With networks that could talk to each\\nother, communication was becoming easier. But all this communication was just text-\\nbased, and it was pretty ugly to look at. In the 1980s, a Brit called\\nTimothy Berners-Lee spent time with CERN, the European\\nOrganization for Nuclear Research, where physicists are trying to work out\\nwhat the universe is made of. He wanted to manage the scientists’\\ninformation and make it possible for them to share and interconnect\\ntheir work easily, making progress more likely. He did so by inventing an interface\\nusing HTTP, HTML, and URLs that made internet browsers possible. He called his browser the World Wide Web. So he didn’t invent the internet,\\nbut he did invent the Web. The first ever website, which he created,\\nwas at CERN in France in August 1991. So, once the initial infrastructure\\nwas in place, the key technologies had been invented, internet message boards\\nexploded in the 1980s, the phone companies saw the commercial\\npotential of digital communication, web browsers spread like wildfire in the\\nearly 1990s, and ordinary people discovered email, then the internet expanded\\nrapidly and steadily and became workable for the masses\\nfrom about 1995. Hold on, didn’t US Vice President Al Gore\\ninvent the internet? Ugh… no. And if you read what he said exactly,\\nyou’ll know he never claimed to have done. But many people credit him with\\nenergetically pushing legislation that encouraged the spread\\nof the internet. The internet exists because we\\nneed to communicate, and most of us like doing it. That’s why humans have become\\nthe dominant species on Earth. You could argue that the internet is\\na natural evolutionary step and a manifestation of that need. It wasn’t invented by anyone\\nin particular, but when the building blocks were put\\ntogether by all those cool scientists from all over the place, the internet\\nbecame a communication tool, a retail tool, a research tool,\\na propaganda tool, a spying tool, a shopping tool, a dating tool,\\nan entertainment tool, and a way of skiving off work while making\\nit look like you’re working or studying, which is what you may be doing now. Ultimately, though, you’re communicating,\\nespecially if you leave a comment, and that might make you a\\nbetter human being. Subtitles by the Amara.org community\", 'The beginning of everything. The Big Bang. The idea that the universe was suddenly\\nborn and is not infinite. Up to the middle of the 20th century,\\nmost scientists thought of the universe as infinite and ageless. Until Einstein’s theory of relativity gave\\nus a better understanding of gravity, and Edwin Hubble discovered that galaxies\\nare moving apart from one another in a way that fits previous predictions. In 1964, by accident, cosmic background\\nradiation was discovered, a relic of the early universe, which, together with other observational\\nevidence, made the Big Bang the accepted theory in science. Since then, improved technology like the\\nHubble telescope has given us a pretty good picture of the\\nBig Bang and the structure of the cosmos. Recent observations even seem to suggest\\nthat the expansion of the universe is accelerating. But how did this Big Bang work? How can something come from nothing? Let’s explore what we know. We can ignore the beginning part\\nfor now. First of all, the Big Bang was not\\nan explosion. It was all space stretching\\neverywhere all at once. The universe started\\nvery, very, very small and quickly expanded to the\\nsize of a football. The universe didn’t expand into anything,\\nspace was just expanding into itself. The universe cannot expand into anything\\nbecause the universe has no borders; there is, by definition, no “outside”\\nthe universe. The universe is all there is. In this hot, dense environment, energy\\nmanifested itself in particles that existed only for the\\ntiniest glimpses of time. >From gluons, pairs of quarks were created,\\nwhich destroyed one another, perhaps after giving off more gluons. These found other short-lived quarks\\nto interact with, forming new quark pairs and\\ngluons again. Matter and energy were not just\\ntheoretically equivalent, it was so hot they were practically\\nthe same stuff. Somewhere around this time, matter\\nwon over antimatter. Today, we’re left with almost all\\nmatter and nearly no antimatter at all. Somehow, one billion and one matter\\nparticles were formed for every one billion particles of\\nantimatter. Instead of one massive ultimate force\\nin the universe, there were now several refined versions\\nof it acting under different rules. By now the universe has stretched to a\\nbillion kilometers in diameter, which leads to a decrease in temperature. The cycle of quarks being born and\\nconverted back to energy suddenly stops. >From now on, we work with what we have. Quarks begin forming new particles,\\nhadrons, like protons and neutrons. There are many, many combinations of\\nquarks that can form all sorts of hadrons, but only very few are reasonably stable\\nfor any length of time. Please take a moment to appreciate that\\nby now, only one second has passed since the beginning of everything. The universe, which has grown to one\\nhundred billion kilometers, is now cold enough to allow most of the\\nneutrons to decay into protons and form the first atom, hydrogen. Imagine the universe at this point as an\\nextremely hot soup, ten billion degrees Celsius, filled with\\ncountless particles and energy. Over the next few minutes, things cooled\\nand settled down very fast. Atoms formed out of hadrons and electrons, making for a stable and electrically\\nneutral environment. Some call this period the Dark Age,\\nbecause there were no stars and the hydrogen gas didn’t allow visible\\nlight to move around. But what’s the meaning of visible light,\\nanyway, when there’s nothing alive yet that could have eyes? When the hydrogen gas clumped together\\nafter millions of years and gravity put it under great pressure, stars\\nand galaxies began to form. Their radiation dissolved the stable\\nhydrogen gas into a plasma that still permeates the universe today\\nand allows visible light to pass. Finally, there was light! Okay, but what about the part\\nwe didn’t talk about? What happened right at the beginning? This part can be defined as the Big Bang. We don’t know at all what happened here. At this point, our tools break down. Natural laws stop making sense,\\ntime itself becomes wibbly-wobbly. To understand what happened here,\\nwe need a theory that unifies Einstein’s relativity and quantum\\nmechanics, something countless scientists are working on right now. But this leaves us with lots of\\nunanswered questions. Were there universes before our own? Is this the first and only universe? What started the Big Bang, or did it\\njust occur naturally, based on laws we don’t understand yet? We don’t know, and maybe we never will. But what we do know is that the universe\\nas we know it started here and gave birth to particles, galaxies,\\nstars, the Earth, and you. Since were ourselves are made of\\ndead stars, we are not separate from the universe; we are part of it. You could even say that we are the\\nuniverse’s way of experiencing itself. So, let’s keep on experiencing it, until\\nthere are no more questions to ask. Subtitles by the Amara.org community', \"One day the universe will die. But why? And how? And will the universe\\nbe dead forever? And how do we know that? First of all, the universe is expanding. And not only that, the rate of\\nits expansion is accelerating. The reason: dark energy. Dark energy is a strange phenomenon that\\nscientists believe permeates the universe. Until 1998 we thought that the universe\\nmust work a bit like a ball that you throw into the sky. The ball moves up, but at some point\\nit has to come down again. But the expansion of the universe\\nis actually speeding up. That’s like throwing a ball up\\nand watching it fly away faster and faster and faster. Where is this acceleration coming from? Well, we don’t know, but\\nwe call it “dark energy”. Einstein thought of it first and\\nthen decided it was stupid. Now, astrophysicists have\\ndecided it is plausible. Trouble is, this is all very theoretical,\\nand we don’t actually know what the properties of dark energy are. But there are various theories and they\\nlead us to three scenarios for the end of the universe. One: the Big Rip. Since its birth, the universe\\nhas been expanding. For unknown reasons new spaces\\ncreated everywhere equally. The space between galaxies expands,\\nso they move apart. The space inside galaxies also expands,\\nbut here, gravity is strong enough to keep them together. In the Big Rip scenario, the expansion\\naccelerates up to a point where space expands so fast that gravity\\ncan’t compensate for this effect anymore. The result is a Big Rip. At first, only large structures like\\ngalaxies are torn apart, since space between the single objects\\nexpands very fast. Next, big bodies like black holes,\\nstars, and planets die. Their gravity isn’t strong enough to keep\\nthem together, so they dissolve into their components. In the end, space would expand\\nfaster than the speed of light. Atoms would now be affected,\\nand they would just disband. Once space is expanding faster than light,\\nno particle in the universe can interact with any other particle anymore. The universe would dissolve into countless\\nlonely particles that won’t be able to touch anything else in a strange,\\ntimeless universe. Hmm, and you thought you felt lonely! Two: Heat death or a Big Freeze. In a nutshell, the difference between\\nthe Big Rip and heat death is that in a heat death scenario matter stays\\nintact and is converted over an incredibly long but finite period\\nof time into radiation, while the universe expands forever. But how does this work?\\nLet’s talk about entropy. Every system tends towards the\\nstate of highest entropy, like when we have a latte macchiato. Initially, it has different regions, but\\nover time, they will cool down and disintegrate,\\nuntil it’s uniform. And this also applies to the universe. So, while the universe gets\\nbigger and bigger, matters slowly decays and spreads out. At some point, after lots of generations\\nof stars, all the gas clouds necessary to form stars will be exhausted,\\nso the universe will turn dark. The remaining suns will die;\\n black holes will slowly degenerate\\nand evaporate over trillions of years due to what’s known as Hawking radiation. When this process is complete, only a\\ndilute gas of photons and light particles remains, until even this decays. All activity in the universe ceases\\nat this point; entropy is at its maximum and\\nthe universe is dead forever. Unless… theoretically, it might\\nbe possible that after an incredibly\\nlong amount of time, there might be a spontaneous entropy\\ndecrease as a result of something called “quantum tunneling”, leading to\\na new Big Bang. Three: Big Crunch and Big Bounce. This is the most uplifting scenario. If there is less dark energy than we think\\nor it decreases over time, gravity will be the dominating force in the\\nuniverse one day. In a few trillion years, the rate of\\nexpansion of the universe will slow down and stop. After that, it reverses. Galaxies will race at each other,\\nmerging as the universe becomes smaller and smaller. Since a smaller universe also means\\na hotter universe, temperatures rise everywhere all at once. One hundred thousand years before the Big\\nCrunch, background radiation would be hotter than the surfaces of the\\nmost stars, which means that they would be cooked from the outside. Minutes before the Big Crunch happens,\\natom cores are ripped apart, before supermassive black holes\\ndevour everything. Finally, all black holes would emerge into\\na supermassive mega-black hole that contains the entire\\nmass of the universe, and in the last moment before\\nthe Big Crunch it would devour the universe,\\nincluding itself. The Big Bounce theory states that this\\nhas happened a lot of times and that the universe goes through\\nan infinite cycle of expansion and contraction. Well, wouldn’t that be nice? So what will actually happen to\\nthe universe in the end? At the moment, heat death seems the most\\nlikely, but we at Kurzgesagt hope that this “dead forever” stuff is wrong and the\\nuniverse will start over and over again. We don't know for sure either way, so\\nlet’s just assume the most uplifting theory is true. By the way, we have a Twitter account.

The Stock Exchange is nothing more \\nthan a giant globally network tend to organize the market place where every day \\nhuge sums of money are moved back and forth. In total over sixty trillion (60,000,000,000,000) \\nEuros a year are traded. More than the value of all goods and services \\nof the entire world economy. However it's not apples or second hand \\ntoothbrushes that are traded on this marketplace. But predominantly securities. Securities are rights to assets, \\nmostly in the form of shares. A share stands for \\na share in a company. But why are shares traded at all? Well, first and foremost the value of a share \\nrelates to the company behind it. If you think the value of \\na company in terms of a pizza. The bigger the overal size of the pizza, \\nthe bigger every piece is. If for example Facebook is able to greatly \\nincrease its profits with a new buisness model. The size of the companies pizza will also increase, \\nand as a result so will the value of its shares. This is of course great for the share holders. A share which perhaps used to be worth 38 euros \\ncould now be worth a whole 50 euros. When it's sold this represents \\na profit of twelve euro per share! But what does Facebook gain from this? The company can raise funds by selling \\nthe shares and invest or expand it's buisness. Facebook, for example, has earned sixteen billion \\ndollars from it's listing on the Stock Exchange. The trading of shares though, \\nis frequently a game of chance. No one can say which company \\nwill preform well and which will not. If a company has a good reputation, \\ninvestors will back it. A company with a poor reputation or poor \\nperformance will have difficulty selling its shares. Unlike a normal market in which goods \\ncan be touched and taken home on the Stock Exchange only \\nvirtual goods are available. They apear in the form of share prices \\nand tables on monitors. Such shareprices can rise \\nor fall within seconds. Shareholders therefore have to act quickly \\nin order not to miss an opportunity. Even a simple rumor can result in the demand for \\na share falling fast regardless of the real value of the company. Of course the opposite is also possible. If a particularly large number\\nof people buy weak shares. Because if they see for example \\ngreat potential behind an idea. Their value will rise as a result. In particular young companies \\ncan benefit from this. Even though their sales might be falling, \\nthey can generate cash by placing their shares. In the best case scenario this will result in \\ntheir idea being turned into reality. In the worst case scenario, this will result in a \\nspeculative bubble with nothing more than hot air. And as the case with bubbles, \\nat some point, they will burst. The value of Germany's biggest thirty companies \\nis summarized in what is known as the DAX share index. The DAX shows how well or poorly \\nthese major companies and there by the economy as a whole \\nare performing at the present time.

Subtitles by the Amara.org community\", 'The ocean conveyor belt and\\nthe Gulf Stream. Ocean currents have a direct\\ninfluence on our lives. They determine our weather, our\\nclimate, and much more. The ocean currents and wind systems transport heat from the equator\\nto the poles and operate like a large engine\\nfor the global climate. In the oceans, there are numerous\\ncurrents. The so-called ocean conveyor belt\\nis very important for our climate. This term describes a combination\\nof currents that result in four of the five global\\noceans exchanging water with each other. They form a worldwide circulation system. The conveyor belt is also called the\\nthermohaline circulation, with “thermo” referring to\\nthe temperature, and “haline” to the salt content\\nof the water. Both determine the density of the water. While the masses of water may be\\nmoved in part by wind, primarily the different densities\\nof the global oceans are responsible for their movement. Warm water has a lower density and rises\\nwhile cold water sinks. The water’s density also increases with\\na higher salt content. At the equator the heat from the\\nsun is especially strong, resulting in a lot of evaporation and\\nthus a rise in the water’s salt content. That is where the Gulf Stream begins. The Gulf Stream is very important\\nfor the European climate. Its length of 10,000 km makes it one of\\nthe largest and fastest currents on Earth, and it’s very warm. At roughly 2 m/s it brings up to\\n100,000,000 m³ of water per second towards Europe. A constantly blowing wind, the\\nsoutheast trade wind, drives warm surface water to\\nthe northwest, into the Gulf of Mexico, where it heats up\\nto 30 °C. The turning of the Earth and the\\nwest winds then direct the Gulf Stream towards Europe\\nand split it up. One part flows south, another east\\nto the Canary Current, and a third part flows north where\\nit releases a lot of heat into the atmosphere as the\\nNorth Atlantic Current. The water becomes colder there. Its salt content and density rise on\\nthe account of evaporation and it drops down between\\nGreenland, Norway, and Iceland. There we also find the largest\\nwaterfall on Earth. The so-called Chimneys, roughly 15-km-wide\\npillars with water falling up to 4,000 m. 17,000,000 m³ of water per second, or\\nroughly 15 times more water than is carried by all the rivers in the world. This creates a strong maelstrom, which\\nconstantly pulls in new water and is the reason that the Gulf Stream\\nmoves towards Europe. Countless species use the Gulf Stream as a\\nmeans of transport on their trips from the Caribbean to northern areas. But it doesn’t just bring us animals; an enormous quantity of warm air also\\ncomes with it. In order to produce the same heat that it\\nbrings to the shores of Europe, we would need 1,000,000 nuclear\\npower plants. That’s why we also call the Gulf Stream\\na heat pump. Without it, the temperature would\\nbe significantly colder here, at least five to ten degrees. Instead of lush fields, we would have\\nlong winters and sparse ice-covered landscapes in Europe. In the last few years, scientists and\\npundits in the media have repeatedly expressed the fear that the Gulf Stream\\ncould come to a standstill due to climate change. Because if the polar caps actually melt,\\nthe salt content in the water off Greenland would fall, as would\\nits density. The North Atlantic Current would no longer\\nbe heavy enough, and so it woundn’t sink as usual. In the worst case, that would bring the\\nGulf Stream, our heat pump, to a stop. Some climate experts also assume that\\nclimate change could compensate for this effect. We know that it can be normal for the\\nclimate to change by looking at the development of the Earth\\nover the last few million years. There are ice ages and warm periods. In the last ice age, a gigantic flood of\\nmelting water crippled the heat-bringing North Atlantic Current,\\ncovering the northern hemisphere in ice. Scientists have different views on the\\nimpact that climate change will have on the global ocean conveyor belt, but\\none thing is clear: when the climate changes, then the complex\\nsystem of ocean currents and winds, which has remained fairly stable since the\\nlast ice age, will change in ways that we don’t\\nyet understand. Subtitles by the Amara.org community', 'What is hydraulic fracturing – or fracking ? Since the industrial revolution our energy consumption has risen unceasingly. The majority of this energy consumption is supplied by fossil fuels like coal or natural gas. Recently there has been a lot of talk about a controversial method of extracting natural gas: Hydraulic fracturing or fracking. Put simply, fracking describes the recovery of natural gas from deep layers inside the earth. In this method, porous rock is fractured by the use of water, sand and chemicals in order to release the enclosed natural gas. The technique of fracking has been known since the 1940s. Nonetheless, only in the last ten years has there been quite a “fracking boom”, especially in the USA. This is because most conventional natural gas sources in America and on the European continent have been exhausted. Thus prices for natural gas and other fuels are rising steadily. Significantly more complicated and expensive methods, like fracking, have now become attractive and profitable. In the meantime, fracking has already been used more than a million times in the USA alone. Over 60% of all new oil and gas wells are drilled by using fracking. Now let’s take a look at how fracking actually works: First, a shaft is drilled several hundred meters into the earth. From there, a horizontal hole is drilled into the gas-bearing layer of rock. Next, the fracking fluid is pumped into the ground using high-performance pumps. On average, the fluid consists of 8 million liters of water which amounts to about the daily consumption of 65,000 people. plus several thousand tons of sand and about 200,000 liters of chemicals. The mixture penetrates into the rock layer and produces innumerable tiny cracks. The sand prevents the cracks from closing again. The chemicals perform various tasks among other things, they condense the water, kill off bacteria or dissolve minerals. Next, the majority of the fracking fluid is pumped out again. And now the natural gas can be recovered. As soon as the gas source is exhausted, the drill hole is sealed. As a rule, the fracking fluid is pumped back into deep underground layers and sealed in there. However, fracking is also associated with several considerable risks. The primary risk consists in the contamination of drinking water sources. Fracking not only consumes large quantities of fresh water, but in addition the water is subsequently contaminated and is highly toxic. The contamination is so severe that the water cannot even be cleaned in a treatment plant. Even though the danger is known and theoretically could be managed, in the USA already sources have been contaminated due to negligence. No one yet knows how the enclosed water will behave in the future, since there have not yet been any long-term studies on the subject. The chemicals used in fracking vary from the hazardous to the extremely toxic and carcinogenic, such as benzol or formic acid. The companies using fracking say nothing about the precise composition of the chemical mixture. But it is known that there are about 700 different chemical agents which can be used in the process. Another risk is the release of greenhouse gases. The natural gas recovered by fracking consists largely of methane, a greenhouse gas which is 25 times\\nmore potent than carbon dioxide. Natural gas is less harmful than coal when burned. But nonetheless, the negative effects of fracking on the climate balance are overall greater. Firstly, the fracking process requires\\na very large consumption of energy. Secondly, the drill holes are quickly exhausted and it is necessary to drill fracking holes much more frequently than for classical natural gas wells. In addition, about 3% of the recovered gas is lost in the extraction and escapes into the atmosphere. So how is fracking and its expected benefits to be assessed when the advantages are balanced against the disadvantages? When properly employed, this technique offers one way in the short to medium term for meeting our demand for lower-cost energy. But the long-term consequences of fracking are unforeseeable and the risk to our drinking water thus should not be underestimated.

evolution? Evolution is the development of life on Earth. This is a process that began billions of years ago and is still continuing to this day. Evolution tells us how it was possible for the enormous diversity of life to develop. It shows us how primitive Protozoa could become the millions of different species that we see today. Evolution, then, is the answer to the question that we have all asked on seeing a Daschund and a Great Dane together: how is it possible for ancestors to have descendants that look so very different to them? In answering this question, we want to focus on animals, excluding other forms of life such as fungi and plants. The first question to ask is therefore: how can one animal develop into a whole new species of animal? Ah, but just a quick question: what exactly is a species? A species is a community of animals that is capable of producing offspring with one another, with those offspring also being capable of reproducing in turn. To understand this answer better, we need to take a closer look at the following points: the uniqueness of living creatures, guaranteed through the excess production of offspring and heredity, and as a second key point, selection. Let's begin with uniqueness. Every creature that exists is unique, and this is essential for evolution. The members of a species may strongly resemble each other in appearance; however, they all have slightly different traits and characteristics. They may be a bit bigger, fatter, stronger, or bolder than their fellow animals. So, what is the reason for these differences? Let's take a closer look at a creature. Every creature is made up of cells. These cells have a nucleus. The nucleus contains the chromosomes, and the chromosomes hold the DNA. DNA consists of different genes, and it's these genes that are life's information carriers. They contain instructions and orders for the cells, and determine the characteristics and traits that living creatures have, and it's precisely this DNA that is unique to every creature. It's slightly different from individual to individual, which is why each has slightly different characteristics. But how is the enormous range of DNA created? One key factor is the excess production of offspring. In nature, we can observe that creatures generally produce far more offspring than is necessary for the survival of their species, with many offspring dying an early death as a result. Often there are even more offspring than the environment in which they live is able to support. This is one factor in increasing diversity within a species. The more offspring that are produced, the more little differences occur, and this is what nature wants: as many little differences as possible. The second major cause of the uniqueness of individuals occurs in heredity itself. By the way, heredity means the passing on of DNA to offspring. Two very interesting factors come into play in this process: recombination and mutation. Recombination is the random mixing of the DNA of two creatures. When two creatures fall in love and mate, they recombine their genes twice. The first time, they do this separately when they generate the gametes - that is, sperm and egg cells. The gametes take half of the genes and shuffle them. The second recombination occurs when a male inseminates a female. The parents each provide 50% of their DNA, in other words, 50% of their unique traits and characteristics. These are then recombined, or mixed, and the result is new offspring. These offspring have a random mix of the DNA, and therefore the traits and characteristics of their parents. This increases the diversity and differences within a species even further, but mutations are also important for evolution. Mutations are random changes in DNA. These can also be described as copying errors within the DNA, triggered by toxins or other chemical substances, or by radiation. A mutation exists when part of the DNA is altered. These changes are often negative, and may result in illnesses such as cancer. However, they may also have neutral or positive effects, such as the blue eye colour in humans, which is one such random mutation. In all cases, a mutation has to affect a gamete, that is a sperm or egg cell, because only the DNA in the gametes is passed on to the offspring. This is also the reason why we protect our sexual organs during x-rays, whilst other parts of the body are not at risk. In summary then, in the heredity process, creatures pass on their characteristics to their offspring in the form of DNA. Recombination and mutation change the DNA so that each child looks different to its siblings, and receives a random mix of the characteristics of its parents. There's a key word here: random. All of these processes are based on chance. Random recombination and mutations result in individuals with random mixes of traits and characteristics, which in turn mix these randomly, and pass them on. But how can so much be down to chance, when all living creatures are so perfectly adapted to their environment, for example, the stick insect, the hummingbird, and the frogfish? The answer is provided by the second key point: selection. Each individual is subjected to a process of natural selection. As we have learned, each individual is somewhat different to its fellows, and there is extensive variation within a species. Environmental influences have an effect on living creatures. These so-called selection factors include: predators, parasites, animals of the same species, toxins, changes in habitat, or the climate. Selection is a process that each individual is subjected to. Every creature has a unique mix of traits and characteristics. This mix helps them to survive in their environment, or not, as the case may be. Anyone with an unsuitable mix will be selected from the environment. Those with the right mix survive, and can pass on their enhanced traits and characteristics. This is why diversity is so important. This is why creatures make so much effort to produce offspring that are as different as possible. They increase the likelihood that at least one of their offspring passes nature's selection process. They maximize their chances of survival. A good example of this can be seen in a group of finches living on a remote island. They are some of the most famous animals in the world of science, and are known as Darwin finches, after their discoverer, Charles Darwin, and this is the story of those finches. A few hundred years ago, a small group of finches was blown onto the Galapagos Islands in the middle of the Pacific, probably by a big storm. The finches found themselves in an environment that was completely new to them, a real finch paradise: an abundance of food and no predators. They reproduced rapidly and numerously. The islands were soon heaving with finches. This meant that food supplies became increasingly scarce. The finch paradise was threatened with famine, and finch friends became competitors. This is when selection intervened. Their individuality and small differences, in this case their slightly different beaks, meant that some of the birds were able to avoid competing with their fellow finches. The beaks of some of the finches were more suitable for digging for worms. Other finches were able to use their beaks better for cracking seeds. The finches consequently sort out ecological niches. In these niches, they were safe from excessive competition. They soon began to mate primarily with other finches that used the same niche. Over the course of many generations, these characteristics were enhanced, enabling the finches to exploit their niches successfully. The differences between the worm-diggers and the seed-crackers became so large that they were no longer able to mate with one another. Different species emerged as a result. Today, there are 14 different species of finch living on the Galapagos Islands, all of which are descended from the same group of stranded finches. This is how new species are created by evolution: through the interaction of unique individuals, the excess production of offspring, recombination and mutation in heredity, and finally, through selection. Why is this so important? It tells us where the variety of life comes from, and why living creatures are so perfectly adapted to their habitats. But it also effects us personally. Every person is the result of 3.5 billion years of evolution, and that includes you. Your ancestors fought and adapted in order to survive. This survival was an extremely uncertain thing. If we consider the fact that 99% of all the species that have ever lived are extinct, then you can consider yourself part of a success story. The dinosaurs have disappeared, but you are alive, watching this video, because you're incredibly special, just like all the other creatures that exist today: irreproducible and unique in the universe.\"]\n"
