I built a youtube search tool using cosine similarity (trained on titles and transcripts of each video) for a Kurtzgesagt youtube channel. The results are based on the similarity between user's input query with combination of transcripts and titles. I made an API out of this cosine similarity model using FastAPI, containzeried it, and posted it on Docker Hub, from where I was able to make an AWS ECS instance that hosts access to my model's API

## 📖 Overview
I built a **YouTube semantic search tool** using **cosine similarity** (trained on titles and transcripts of each video) for the **Kurzgesagt** YouTube channel.  

🔍 The results are based on the **similarity between the user’s input query** and a combination of video transcripts + titles.  

⚡ I exposed the similarity model through a **FastAPI service**, containerized it with **Docker**, and deployed it on **AWS ECS** to make the API publicly accessible.

## ✨ Features
- 🔎 **Semantic Search** → finds videos by meaning, not just keywords  
- ⚡ **FastAPI Backend** → lightweight, high-performance API  
- 📦 **Dockerized** → portable & reproducible deployments  
- ☁️ **AWS ECS Deployment** → API hosted in the cloud  
- 🎨 **Gradio UI** → interactive frontend for quick demo
